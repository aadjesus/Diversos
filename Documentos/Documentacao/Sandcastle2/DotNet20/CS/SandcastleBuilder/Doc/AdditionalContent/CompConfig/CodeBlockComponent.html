<h2>The Code Block Component</h2>
The Code Block Component is used to extend the functionality of the
XML comments <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.  It provides the following
features:

<ul>
    <li>Excess leading whitespace is stripped from the
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks to left-align them correctly.</li>
    <li>It adds support for optional line numbering.</li>
    <li>It adds support for optional collapsible regions for code in
<code>#region</code> and <code>#if/#else/#endif</code> blocks with support
for nested collapsible regions.  The VB.NET equivalents are supported too.</li>
    <li>A default title can be added based on the language that the code
represents.</li>
    <li>A "Copy" link appears to the right on the title line that allows you
to copy the code sample to the clipboard (Internet Explorer only).  The code
is copied as plain text without the highlighting and line numbers if used.</li>
    <li>It adds support for reading in an external source file or a defined
region of an external source file so that you can keep code samples in a
buildable project to test them for correctness and to do away with managing
the code samples in the XML comments or include files.</li>
    <li>C#, VB.NET, C++, and J# code blocks can be associated with the
language filter to show or hide them based on the language filter setting.</li>
    <li>Syntax highlighting of code blocks in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
tags.  Languages supported include C#, VB.NET, C++, J#, C, JavaScript,
VBScript, and XML.  An external configuration file is used so that it is
possible to extend the colorizer to support other languages.  The
stylesheet is also replaceable. All of the features noted above are
available whether or not you enable the colorizing feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Code Block Attributes</h3>
The code colorizer is a modified and extended version of the one written by
Jonathan de Halleux in the Code Project article
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/highlightcs.asp">Multiple
Language Syntax Highlighting, Part 2:
C# Control </a>[<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/highlightcs.asp"
target="_blank">^</a>].  The modified code is available with the source
download for the help file builder and the build components. The following
attributes can be added to the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. They can be
used in any combination with each other with the exception of
<code>region</code> which, if used, must be paired with a
<code>source</code> attribute.  All attribute names and values are
case-sensitive.

<dl>
    <dt><b>The <code>source</code> and <code>region</code> Attributes</b></dt>
    <dd>This feature is based on an idea suggested by Morten Nielsen in the
MSDN Documentation Forum.  The <code>source</code> attribute is used to
specify that the code block's content should be read from an external
source code file.  If used alone, the entire file is used.  The optional
<code>region</code> attribute can be used to limit the code to a specific
section of the file delimited with the named <code>#region</code>.  The
<code>#region</code> and <code>#endregion</code> tags are excluded from the
extracted section of code.

<p/>This is not to be confused with the XML comments
<code>&lt;include&gt;</code> tag. This extension is intended to extract
code from actual source files.  This allows you to manage your code
examples in buildable projects to test them for correctness as a project is
developed and altered in the future.  It also saves you from managing the
code in the XML comments and does not require that the code be HTML encoded
as it is when written in the comments. The code will be HTML encoded when
it is read in for processing.  When used, it is assumed that there is no
code within the comment tag itself, it will always be self-closing. Here
are some examples:

<p/>Retrieve all code from an external file and use the VB.NET syntax to
color it.  The path is relative to the <code>basePath</code> configuration
element.

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
&lt;code source="..\Examples\WholeDemo.vb" lang="vbnet" /&gt;
</pre>

Retrieve a specific <code>#region</code> from an external file.

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
&lt;code source="..\Examples\SeveralExamples.vb"
    region="Example 1" lang="vbnet" title="Example #1" /&gt;
</pre>

Note that VB.NET does not allow <code>#Region</code> and <code>#End
Region</code> within a method body.  However, if you want to extract a
region from a VB.NET method body, you can add the <code>#Region</code> and
<code>#End Region</code> statements in comments to workaround the
limitation.  The component will still find it and extract the region.</dd>

    <dt><b>The <code>lang</code> Attribute</b></dt>
    <dd>This attribute allows you to override the default language specified
in the component's configuration.  Any <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag without
a <code>lang</code> attribute will use the value specified in the component's
configuration.  For example, if most or all of your code examples are
in C#, you can set the default language in the configuration to "cs".  If
you have an example in VB.NET, you can add <code>lang="vbnet"</code> to
colorize that example as VB.NET code.  The possible language values in
the supplied configuration file are as follows:

<ul>
    <li>cs = C#</li>
    <li>cpp = C++</li>
    <li>c = C</li>
    <li>jscript = JavaScript</li>
    <li>vbnet = VB.NET</li>
    <li>vbscript = VBScript</li>
    <li>jsharp = J#</li>
    <li>xml = XML</li>
    <li>Anything else (i.e. "none") = No highlighting</li>
</ul><br/></dd>

    <dt><b>The <code>numberLines</code> Attribute</b></dt>
    <dd>This attribute allows you to override the default setting in the
component's configuration.  For example, if the default setting is false to
turn off line numbering, you can add <code>numberLines="true"</code>
to enable numbering on a specific code example.<br/><br/></dd>

    <dt><b>The <code>outlining</code> Attribute</b></dt>
    <dd>This attribute allows you to override the default setting in the
component's configuration.  For example, if the default setting is false to
not add collapsible regions, you can add <code>outlining="true"</code> to
enable collapsible regions on a specific code example.  Note that if a code
block contains no <code>#region</code> or <code>#if</code> blocks,
outlining is automatically disabled and it will not reserve space in the
margin for the markers.<br/><br/></dd>

    <dt><b>The <code>tabSize</code> Attribute</b></dt>
    <dd>When the code blocks are formatted, tab characters are replaced
with a set number of spaces to preserve formatting.  This attribute can be
used to override the default setting for a language which is specified in
the syntax file.  For example, if the default tab size for a language is
four, adding <code>tabSize="8"</code> will force it to use eight spaces
instead.  If set to zero, the syntax file setting is used.  This attribute
has the same behavior when used in the component's
configuration.<br/><br/></dd>

    <dt><b>The <code>title</code> Attribute</b></dt>
    <dd>This attribute allows you to add a title that appears before the
code block.  An example of its use would be to label the example with a
description.  If omitted and the <code>defaultTitle</code> attribute on the
code block component's <code>colorizer</code> element is true, the language
name will appear for the title.  If it is set to false, no title will
appear.  If using default titles and you do not want a title on a particular
block, set the <code>title</code> attribute to a single space (" ").</dd>
</dl>

<p/>NDoc had an additional <code>escaped</code> attribute that let you
enter literal XML in the comments block without having to HTML encode
things like the angle brackets.  An attempt was made to support that
attribute in the code block component.  However, the XML document as
created by Sandcastle and passed to the component has all inter-element
whitespace and line feeds stripped from it.  As such, it loses all
formatting in the escaped XML and renders it on a single, unbroken line.
This made the <code>escaped</code> attribute useless and it was removed. If
you want to include XML or other unencoded information, utilize the
<code>source</code> attribute instead to read it in from an external file.
Doing it this way preserves the formatting and has the same effect as the
<code>escaped</code> attribute in NDoc.

<h3>The Code Block Component Configuration</h3>
The following is the default configuration for the code block component. It
should be inserted into the configuration file just ahead of the
<code>TransformComponent</code>.  Note that the
<code>CodeBlockComponent</code> must be paired with the
<code>PostTransformComponent</code> as it is used to insert the script and
stylesheet references in pages that have colorized code.  See below for
details.  All attribute names and values are case-sensitive.

<pre lang="xml" title="Example Configuration">
&lt;!-- Code block component configuration.  This must appear before the
     TransformComponent.  See also: PostTransformComponent. --&gt;
&lt;component type="SandcastleBuilder.Components.CodeBlockComponent"
  assembly="{@SHFBFolder}SandcastleBuilder.Components.dll"
  id="Code Block Component"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Base path for relative filenames in source attributes
         (optional) --&gt;
    &lt;basePath value="{@ProjectFolder}" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Connect to language filter (optional).  If omitted,
         language filtering is enabled by default. --&gt;
    &lt;languageFilter value="true" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Code colorizer options (required).
         Attributes:
            Language syntax configuration file (required)
            XSLT style file (required)
            "Copy" image file URL (required)
            Default language (optional)
            Enable line numbering (optional)
            Enable outlining (optional)
            Tab size override (optional, 0 = Use syntax file setting)
            Use language name as default title (optional) --&gt;
    &lt;colorizer syntaxFile="{@SHFBFolder}Colorizer\highlight.xml"
        styleFile="{@SHFBFolder}Colorizer\highlight.xsl"
        copyImageUrl="../icons/CopyCode.gif"
        language="cs" numberLines="false" outlining="false"
        tabSize="0" defaultTitle="true" /&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</pre>

The example given above is taken from the Sandcastle Help File Builder's
configuration file.  When used with it, you may specify the replacement tag
<code>{@SHFBFolder}</code> to insert the help file builder's folder in the
file path and the <code>{@ProjectFolder}</code> replacement tag to specify
the current project's folder.  These are replaced at build time with the
appropriate values.  These replacement tags can also be specified in the
configuration dialog when configuring project-specific configurations for
the component from within the help file builder.  If using the component in
your own build scripts, replace the tags with an actual absolute or
relative path.

<p/>The <code>basePath</code> element is optional.  If specified, it defines
the base path to use for relative paths in the <code>source</code> attributes
of code blocks.  If omitted or left blank, the current folder at build time
is assumed to be the base path.

<p/>The <code>languageFilter</code> element is optional.  If omitted, or if
specified and set to true, and the code block's language is C#, VB.NET,
C++, or J# it will be connected to the page's language filter so that it is
shown or hidden based on the language filter's setting.  If the
<code>languageFilter</code>'s value is set to false, no language filtering
will occur and all code blocks will be visible at the same time.

<p/>The <code>colorizer</code> element is required along with the
<code>syntaxFile</code>, <code>styleFile</code>, and <code>copyImageUrl</code>
attributes which define the default syntax definition file, the
transformation file used by the colorizer, and the URL to use for the
"Copy" image that appears to the right on the title line. The supplied
<b>highlight.xml</b> file contains the syntax definitions for the languages
supported by the colorizer.  The supplied <b>highlight.xsl</b> file defines
the XSLT transformation used to convert the parsed code block into the
colorized HTML.  The <code>copyImageUrl</code> value is the location of the
image file to use for the "Copy" link.  It should be specified as a path
relative to the HTML output folder (normally <b>html\</b>.  It does not
have to physically exist at the time the component is used.  The
<code>PostTransformComponent</code> copies an image to the appropriate
location.  All other attributes are optional.  If specified, they define
the defaults for code blocks that do not specify the matching attribute.
The optional <code>defaultTitle</code> attribute specifies whether or not
to use the language name as the title if a specific title is not specified.
