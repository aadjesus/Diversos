<h2>Custom Build Components</h2>
Custom build components can be used to add additional features to the help
topics as they are generated by the Sandcastle <b>BuildAssembler.exe</b>
tool and are supported by the help file builder.  The following build
components are supplied with the help file builder and are pre-configured
for you:

<ul>
    <li><a href="ShowMissingComponent.html">The Show Missing Documentation Component</a></li>
    <li><a href="VersionInfoComponent.html">The Version Information Component</a></li>
    <li><a href="CodeBlockComponent.html">The Code Block Component</a></li>
    <li><a href="PostTransformComponent.html">The Post-Transform Component</a></li>
</ul>

Third-party build components can also be added by inserting the component
configuration data into the <b>sandcastle.config</b> file.  It can be found
in the <b>Templates\</b> folder under the installation folder. Refer to the
component's documentation for information on where to insert the component
configuration.

<p/>If written to support it, the help file builder will also allow you to
interactively configure the third-party build components and store the
modified settings in the project file.  This is accomplished using the
project's <code>ComponentConfigurations</code> property.  Select it and click
the "<b>...</b>" button to the right of the property.  A new dialog box will
appear listing the components that allow configuration.  Select the one you
want and click the <b>Configure</b> button.  A custom dialog box will
appear that lets you modify the component's default settings.  Refer to the
component documentation for details on the available settings.

<p/>For information on writing your own custom build components, see the
