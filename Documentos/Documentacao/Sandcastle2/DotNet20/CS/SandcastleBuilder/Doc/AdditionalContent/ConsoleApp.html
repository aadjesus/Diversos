<h2>Console Mode Builder</h2>
To build a help project using the command line tool, run the
<b>SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe</b> executable that can be found in the
installation folder.  In its simplest invocation, it takes one or more
project file names to build and an optional <b>/v</b> option as command
line parameters.  The <b>/v</b> option will display all messages from the
tools during the build process. If not specified, only the build step
indicators are displayed on screen during the build process.  In either
case, full output is always saved to the log file.  As with the GUI
builder, the help file and the log file can be found in the folder
specified in the project's <code>OutputPath</code> property after a build.

<h3>Specifying a Post-Build Event to Build a Help File</h3>
To use the console version in a post-build event of a Visual Studio
project,  right click on the project name in the Solution Explorer, select
<b>Properties</b>, and select the <b>Build Events</b> sub-item. Click in
the <b>Post-build Event Command Line</b> option to enter the command line
to run. You can click the <b>Edit Post-build</b> button to open a dialog
with a larger editor and a list of available macros. Below is an example of
a common command line script that can be used (lines wrapped for display
purposes). Replace the path to the tool with the path where you installed it
on your PC.  The <code>IF</code> statement prevents building the help file
in debug builds where it may not be needed.

<pre lang="none" title="Note: Lines wrapped for display purposes">
IF "$(ConfigurationName)"=="Debug" Goto Exit

"C:\Program Files\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\
  SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe" $(SolutionDir)Doc\TestProject.shfb

:Exit
</pre>

If you want to see verbose output to the console during the build, you
can add the <b>/v</b> command line option.  All messages are always saved to
the log file regardless of whether or not this command line option is used.

<p/>In a solution with multiple projects that are documented by the same
help file builder project, the post-build event should be defined on the
last project built by Visual Studio.  If the projects are documented
individually, you can place a post-build event on each one.

<h3>Other Build Tools</h3>
Other automated build tools also exist.  As long as the build tool supports
execution of command line based executables with parameters such as
<b>SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe</b>, you should be able to integrate it
with the build process in a similar fashion.

<h3>Project Option Overrides</h3>
It is also possible to specify project option overrides via the command
line and to use a response file to contain a complex list of projects and
option overrides to build one or more help files.  The command line syntax
is as follows:<br /><br />

<pre>
SandcastleBuilderConsole [@responseFile] [projectFile] [-options] ...
</pre>

<p/>Prefix options with '-' or '/'.  Option names and values are
case-insensitive. All property option overrides are applied to the last
specified project or a default project if one is not specified.  Property
values should be enclosed in double quotes if they contain spaces, commas,
or other special characters.  All relative paths specified on the command
line and those in a response file are relative to the folder in which the
build process is started for the default project.  When an existing project
is specified, they will be relative to the project's path as usual.

<dl>
    <dt>@responseFile</dt>
    <dd>A filename prefixed with '@' indicates a response file containing a
list of projects and options to use.  Specify one project filename or
option per line.  Nested response files are supported.  Blank lines and
lines starting with '#' (comments) are ignored.  Here is an example response
file that builds three projects.  The first two use default settings with
the specified overrides.  The third loads an existing project and overrides
a couple of its options:<br /><br />

<pre lang="none" title="Example Response File">
# Use default project settings plus these changes for the first one.
# All options are case-insensitive.  Spacing is also irrelevant in
# a response file.
-preliminary = true
-assembly=SandcastleBuilder.Utils.dll
-comments=\DotNet20\CS\TestDoc\CommentsOnly\*.xml
-addcontent= "..\..\..\Doc\AdditionalContent\*.*" , ""
-dependency=.\*.dll

# Load a project and override some of its options
..\..\..\..\TestDoc\Doc\TestDoc.shfb
-Preliminary=true
-CleanIntermediates=true
</pre></dd>

    <dt>projectFile</dt>
    <dd>A filename by itself indicates a project file.  Project options are
reset to those of the specified project.  Any subsequent property options will
override options in the project.</dd>

    <dt>-help or -?</dt>
    <dd>Use this option to display help at the command line.</dd>

    <dt>-verbose or -v</dt>
    <dd>Enable verbose logging.</dd>

    <dt>-new</dt>
    <dd>Start another new project with default settings.  As shown in the
response file example above, this can be used to create a new project with
default settings.   Any project options specified after it will be applied
to the new default project.</dd>

    <dt>-property=value</dt>
    <dd>Set the named project property to the specified value.  This can be
used to override settings in a loaded project file or to set properties in
the default project if one is not specified.  This cannot be used to set
collection properties.  See the following command line options for
information on how to set them.</dd>

    <dt>-assembly=assembly,comments</dt>
    <dd>This option can be used to add an assembly and comments file to
document.  The comments file parameter is optional if named after the
assembly.  In that case, the project will pick it up automatically when the
assembly name is set.  A wildcard can be used to add multiple assemblies to
the project. If used, the comments file parameter is ignored and it is
assumed that the comments files will have names that match the assemblies
but with a ".xml" extension.</dd>

    <dt>-comments=commentsFile</dt>
    <dd>This option can be used to add a 'Comments only' or project/namespace
comments file to document.  This is equivalent to adding an XML comments file
to the project and setting the <b>CommentsOnly</b> property to true.  See
the <a href="GUIProject/SharedSettings.html">Sharing Summary and Namespace
Settings Between Projects</a> topic for information on how to create these
standalone comments files.  Wildcards can be used to add multiple comments
only files at once.</dd>

    <dt>-addcontent=source,dest,exclude</dt>
    <dd>This option can be used to add additional content to the project.
The source path refers to the location of the files to add.  The
destination path refers to a relative folder path under the output HTML
folder to which the files are copied.  If the destination path is omitted,
the content is copied to the root of the output HTML folder.  See the <a
href="GUIProject/AddContent/AddContent.html">Additional Content
Settings</a> topic for more information.  The <code>exclude</code> parameter
is optional.  If specified it should be <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>.  False is the default.  If set to true, it indicates
that the source path is used to specify a list of files that should be
excluded from the additional content.  In such cases, the destination path
is ignored.</dd>

    <dt>-addcontent=source,,true</dt>
<dd>This is similar to the <code>addcontent</code> option above but
indicates an exclusion filespec for the additional content items.  The
destination path parameter is ignored.</dd>

    <dt>-dependency=filespec</dt>
    <dd>This option can be used to add a wildcard, single file, or GAC
dependency to the project.  If adding a GAC reference, it must be enclosed
in double quotes and must be prefixed with "GAC:" in uppercase.</dd>

    <dt>-component=id,config</dt>
    <dd>This option can be used to add a component configuration override.
The ID refers to the component ID specified in the <b>sandcastle.config</b>
file.  The configuration is the XML configuration data to use as an override
for the default configuration in one continuous, unencoded line of text.
Due to the length of the component configurations, it is advisable to
either use a project file to store the settings or use a response file for
this command line option.  See the <a href="CompConfig/CompConfig.html">Custom
Build Components</a> topic for more information on the build components and
their configuration options.</dd>
