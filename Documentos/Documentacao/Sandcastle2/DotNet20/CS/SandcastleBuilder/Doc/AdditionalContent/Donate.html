<h2>Making a Donation</h2>
Several people have asked how to make a donation to support the Sandcastle
Help File Builder project.  If you would like to do so, you can make a
donation of any amount you like by clicking on the PayPal donation button
below.  If you would prefer to donate via check or money order (USD),
please send me an e-mail at
<a href="mailto:Eric@EWoodruff.us?Subject=Sandcastle Help File Builder Donation">Eric@EWoodruff.us</a>
and I will reply with my mailing address.

</p><a href="http://www.EWoodruff.us/SHFBDonate.html" target="_blank"><img src="Images/PayPal.gif" border="0" alt="Make donations with PayPal - it's fast, free and secure!"/></a>
</div>

<p/>The above method of donating is secure. PayPal guarantees your privacy
and security. I never receive details of your payment other than the
amount, your name, e-mail address, and any optionally entered information.

<p/>Thanks to those of you that have made a donation. It is much appreciated!
