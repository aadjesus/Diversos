<h2>The Destination Path</h2>
For additional content files, the <code>DestinationPath</code> property, if
specified, will always be a relative path.  When creating the help file
content, an <i>.\Output</i> folder is created below the working folder to
contain the art, scripts, style sheets, and HTML pages for the content.
Additional content will also be placed in this folder.  For entries without
a destination path, they will be placed directly in the <i>.\Output</i>
folder. For entries with a destination path, the content will be copied to
the named folder beneath the <i>.\Output</i> folder.  Any sub-folders
beneath the source path folder will also be copied to the destination path
recursively.  The destination path name can be different from the source
path if you want.
