<h2>Linking to Namespace Content</h2>
The additional content help text may need to link to other topics in the
help file such as help pages for a namespace, class, method, property, etc.
To provide this ability, the help file builder will scan each HTML
additional content file for XML comment style <code>&lt;see&gt;</code>
tags.  If found, an attempt is made to convert the tag to a link that takes
you to the related help page for the indicated item.  For example:

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
For a list of all classes, see the
&lt;see cref="N:SandcastleBuilder.Utils"&gt;SandcastleBuilder.Utils
Namespace&lt;/see&gt; topic.

See the help for &lt;see cref="SomeClass.DoesNotExist"/&gt; for
more information.
</pre>

In this help file, these are rendered as:

<ul>
    <li>For a list of all classes, see the
<see cref="N:SandcastleBuilder.Utils">SandcastleBuilder.Utils Namespace</see>
topic.</li>
    <li>See the help for <see cref="SomeClass.DoesNotExist" /> for more
information.</li>
</ul>

<p/>The first example uses the supplied inner text as the text for the
hyperlink.  The second example will use the <code>cref</code> value for the
text of the hyperlink.  The <code>cref</code> value can be a full or
partial identifier for an item in any documented namespace as it appears in
the <b>reflection.xml</b> file created by Sandcastle.  The page names for
the namespace items are generated at build time so the help file builder
attempts to match the identifier with an entry in the reflection
information XML file in order to obtain the correct filename as the target
of the hyperlink.  If a prefix is supplied on the identifier such as
<code>N:</code> (namespace), <code>T:</code> (type), <code>M:</code>
(method), etc. as shown in the first example, an attempt is made to find an
entry starting with the identifier.  If no prefix is supplied, as shown in
the second example, an attempt is made to find a match that ends with the
identifier. If neither of those returns a match, it searches for any entry
that contains the identifier.

<p/>Messages are written to the log file indicating how the link was
resolved.  If no matches are found, a message appears in the log stating
that the identifier could not be found and it will be rendered in bold
rather than as a link in the help file as is the case with the second
example.  If a single best match is found, the log message indicates the
fully qualified name that was matched and the tag is converted to a link to
the associated page in the help file.  If multiple matches are found, the
log will include a list of all fully qualified names that contained the
identifier and the first entry found will be used as the target of the
hyperlink.
