<h2>Replacing Stock Content</h2>
Another benefit of the additional content implementation is that it is
possible to replace the stock content that appears in each help file.  The
stock content is copied from the Sandcastle installation folder and
consists of the following:

<ul>
    <li>The <b>icons\</b> folder contains stock help file images (i.e. for
property icons, method icons, etc).</li>
    <li>The <b>scripts\</b> folder contains stock JavaScript files.</li>
    <li>The <b>styles\</b> folder contains stock style sheets.</li>
</ul>

In addition, the <b>html\</b> folder is created to contain the help pages
generated from the documentation assemblies.  By adding an additional
content entry that copies from a source path in your project to one of the
stock paths above, you can replace the default entry of the same name. For
example, I have customized the style sheet to modify the default font size,
remove the indent from code blocks, and add underlines on hyperlinks when
the mouse hovers over them.  To copy in the custom style sheet, I can add
an additional content entry similar to the following:

<pre>
<b>SourcePath:</b> Styles\presentation.css
<b>DestPath:</b>   Styles\
</pre>

<br/><br/>
<include item="footer"/>
