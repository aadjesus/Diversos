<h2>Project Properties and Shared Content</h2>
The help file build will resolve references to project properties and to
items in the <b>shared_content.xml</b> file.  To substitute project properties
in the additional content files, place them in a tag as in the following
example:

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
&lt;@CopyrightInfo/&gt;
&lt;@FeedbackEMailAddress/&gt;
</pre>

In this help file, these are rendered as:

<ul>
    <li><@CopyrightInfo/></li>
    <li><@FeedbackEMailAddress/></li>
</ul>

Any of the values defined in the <a href="../../CustomBuild.html">Customizing
the Build Process</a> topic can be used.  The only difference is that you
must use angle brackets rather than curly braces in the additional content
files.

<p/>To include shared content items such as the header text, preliminary
text, comments, copyright, or footer, use an include item as in this example:

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
&lt;include item="header"/&gt;
&lt;include item="preliminary"/&gt;
&lt;include item="footer"/&gt;
&lt;include item="comments"/&gt;
&lt;include item="copyright"/&gt;
</pre>

Note that for some items such as <code>footer</code>, the comments and
copyright items are nested within it so there is no need to specify them
separately unless you are customizing the footer area.  The footer at the
end of each additional content page in this help file is created in this
manner so that it matches the footer in the namespace topics.  Another
benefit to this feature is that the items will appear in the language
selected in the project as well.
