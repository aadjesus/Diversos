<h2>The Help File Category Properties</h2>
The following properties are available in the <b>Help File</b> category.
These control the appearance and features of the generated HTML help file.

<ul>
    <li><a href="#BinaryTOC">BinaryTOC</a></li>
    <li><a href="#CopyrightProps">CopyrightHref and CopyrightText</a></li>
    <li><a href="#FeedbackEMailAddress">FeedbackEMailAddress</a></li>
    <li><a href="#FooterText">FooterText</a></li>
    <li><a href="#HeaderText">HeaderText</a></li>
    <li><a href="#HelpTitle">HelpTitle</a></li>
    <li><a href="#HtmlHelpName">HtmlHelpName</a></li>
    <li><a href="#IncludeFavorites">IncludeFavorites</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Language">Language</a></li>
    <li><a href="#NamingMethod">NamingMethod</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Preliminary">Preliminary</a></li>
    <li><a href="#PresentationStyle">PresentationStyle</a></li>
    <li><a href="#PrjLink">ProjectLinkType</a></li>
    <li><a href="#RootNS">RootNamespaceContainer</a></li>

    <li><a href="#SyntaxFilters">SyntaxFilters</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="Reference" name="BinaryTOC">BinaryTOC</a></h3>
When set to true, the default, a binary table of contents is created for the
help file.  According to the HTML Help Compiler documentation this can
significantly reduce the amount of time required to load a very large help
document.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="CopyrightProps">CopyrightHref and CopyrightText</a></h3>
These two properties can be used individually or in combination.  If only
<code>CopyrightHref</code> is specified, a link will appear in the footer
of each page for the specified URL.  If only the <code>CopyrightText</code>
property is specified, that message appears in the footer of each page. If
both are specified, a link appears in the footer of each page using the
text from the <code>CopyrightText</code> property and the target of the
link is set to the URL specified in the <code>CopyrightHref</code>
property. See the <b>Customizing the Header and Footer Text</b> section for
information on how to change the layout of this text.

<p/>The value of the <code>CopyrightText</code> property is treated as
plain text. It will be HTML encoded where necessary to resolve issues
related to the ampersand character and the XML parser.  In addition, you
can encode special characters such as the copyright symbol using an escaped
hex value (i.e. &copy; = \xA9).

<h3><a class="Reference" name="FeedbackEMailAddress">FeedbackEMailAddress</a></h3>
If an e-mail address is specified in this property, an extra message is
included in the footer of each page with a message saying "Send comments on
this topic to" plus the specified e-mail address.  The e-mail address is
rendered as a clickable <b>mailto:</b> link.  See the <b>Customizing the
Header and Footer Text</b> section for information on how to change the
layout of this text.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="FooterText">FooterText</a></h3>
This property can be used to insert an extra message in the footer of each
page.  By default, it is blank.  HTML tags are supported within the text.
See the <b>Customizing the Header and Footer Text</b> section for
information on how to change the layout of the footer section.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="HeaderText">HeaderText</a></h3>
This property can be used to insert an extra message in the header of each
page.  By default, it is blank.  HTML tags are supported within the text.
See the <code>Preliminary</code> property for a way to mark all topics as
preliminary.  See the <b>Customizing the Header and Footer Text</b> section
for information on how to change the layout of the header section.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="HelpTitle">HelpTitle</a></h3>
This property is used to set the title for the help file.  This text will
appear as the title of the help file's window.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="HtmlHelpName">HtmlHelpName</a></h3>
This property is used to specify the name of the HTML help file.  This name is
used during the build process for a couple of other files so be sure that you
do not specify a path or an extension on this value.  It should only specify
the name part of the file.  The extension will always be .CHM and the path is
controlled via the <code>OutputPath</code> property.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="IncludeFavorites">IncludeFavorites</a></h3>
If this property is set to true, a Favorites tab will be included in the
compiled help file.  By default, it is set to false and only the Table of
Contents and Search tabs are available.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="Language">Language</a></h3>
This property allows you to specify the language to use for the compiled
help file.  The default is to use the English language resource files.
Currently, language resource files are also available for German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Portuguese.  If you specify any other
language, the help file will build but you will see a warning in the build
output that the selected language resources could not be found and that it
is defaulting to the US English (en-US) language files.  For more
information on creating additional language resource files, see the help
file topic by that name. If people are kind enough to supply additional
translated files, I will add them in later releases.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="NamingMethod">NamingMethod</a></h3>
This property allows you to specify how the help topic filenames will be
generated.  There are three options:

<ul>
    <li><code>Guid</code> will generate unique GUID values for each topic's
filename.  This is the default value and is suitable for most help files.
While this guarantees unique topic filenames, it does make it impossible to
link to help topics from external sources such as application code or web
pages that are not part of the help file's additional content as the names
change with each build.</li>
    <li><code>MemberName</code> will name each help topic after the member
that it represents.  To avoid problems with invalid filename characters,
the ":", ".", "`" (0x60), and "#" characters are replaced with an
underscore in the member names.  Overloaded methods will generate duplicate
names.  To avoid this problem, all subsequent duplicate names will have a
counter added to the end of their name separated by an underscore (i.e.
<code>M_Type_Method</code>, <code>M_Type_Method_1</code>,
<code>M_Type_Method_2</code>, etc).  When this occurs, a message is
recorded in the log file.  Also note that this may generate extremely long
filenames when the full path is included.  This may cause the build to
fail.  If so, try using the next option.</li>
    <li><code>HashedMemberName</code> will name each topic using the hash
value of the member name in hex format.  This results in a much shorter
filename, even shorter than the GUID names, but it can still be easily
reproduced by an application or ASP.NET web page in order to link to the
help topic.  The actual member name is used without any of the character
replacements noted for the <code>MemberName</code> option.  As with the
<code>MemberName</code> option, overloaded methods will generate duplicate
names.  To avoid this problem, all subsequent duplicate names will have a
counter added to the end of their name separated by an underscore (i.e.
<code>M:Type.Method</code>, <code>M:Type.Method_1</code>,
<code>M:Type.Method_2</code>, etc).  When this occurs, a message is
recorded in the log file.</li>
</ul>

<p/>Note that each help topic ID will have a prefix denoting what it
represents:
<ul>
    <li><code>R:</code> represents the root namespace page.  There will always
be a single entry named <code>R:Project</code>.</li>
    <li><code>N:</code> represents a namespace help topic that lists all of
the members of the given namespace.</li>
    <li><code>T:</code> represents a type help topic that lists all of the
members of the given type.</li>
    <li><code>Overload:</code> represents a help topic that lists all of the
overloads for a particular class member.</li>
    <li><code>F:</code> represents a field member.</li>
    <li><code>E:</code> represents an event member.</li>
    <li><code>P:</code> represents a property.</li>
    <li><code>M:</code> represents a method.</li>
</ul>

<p/>Below are some examples of the member names and their equivalent
filenames.  The values in the first column would be used for the
<code>HashedMemberName</code> option to create the hash value.  The second
column would be used for the <code>MemberName</code> option.

<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="5" width="80%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <th><b>HashedMemberName</b> (value to hash)</td>
    <th><b>MemberName</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R:Project</td>
    <td>R_Project</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>N:SandcastleBuilder.Utils</td>
    <td>N_SandcastleBuilder_Utils</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuildProcess</td>
    <td>T_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuildProcess</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overload:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuilderException.#ctor</td>
    <td>Overload_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuilderException__ctor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.SandcastleProject.DefaultName</td>
    <td>F_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_SandcastleProject_DefaultName</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuildProcess.BuildStepChanged</td>
    <td>E_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuildProcess_BuildStepChanged</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.DependencyItem.DependencyPath</td>
    <td>P_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_DependencyItem_DependencyPath</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>M:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuilderException.#ctor<br/>
        M:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuilderException.#ctor_1 (overload #1)<br/>
        M:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuilderException.#ctor_2 (overload #2)<br/>
        M:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.BuilderException.#ctor_3 (overload #3)</td>
    <td>M_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuilderException__ctor (note the double
underscore before "ctor" due to the "#")<br/>
        M_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuilderException__ctor_1 (overload #1)<br/>
        M_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuilderException__ctor_2 (overload #2)<br/>
        M_SandcastleBuilder_Utils_BuilderException__ctor_3 (overload #3)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p/>To map a member name to its equivalent filename, you can use code
similar to the following.  As noted in the code, the HTML files will reside
in an <b>html\</b> folder and will have a <b>.htm</b> extension so be sure
to add them to the resulting topic filename.

<pre lang="cs" title="C# - MemberName">
Regex reInvalidChars = new Regex("[:.`#]");

// Assume memberName contains the member name of the
// topic to show.
string pageName = reInvalidChars.Replace(
    memberName, "_");

// Show the topic in the help file.  Remember to add
// the "html\" folder name and the ".htm" extension.
Help.ShowHelp(parentForm, helpFilePath,
    HelpNavigator.Topic, @"html\" + pageName + ".htm");
</pre>

<pre lang="vbnet" title="VB.NET - MemberName">
Dim reInvalidChars As New Regex("[:.`#]")

' Assume memberName contains the member name of the
' topic to show.
Dim pageName As String = reInvalidChars.Replace( _
    memberName, "_")

' Show the topic in the help file.  Remember to add
' the "html\" folder name and the ".htm" extension.
Help.ShowHelp(parentForm, helpFilePath, _
    HelpNavigator.Topic, "html\" & pageName & ".htm")
</pre>

<pre lang="cs" title="C# - HashedMemberName">
// Assume memberName contains the member name of the
// topic to show.
string pageName = String.Format("{0:X}",
    memberName.GetHashCode());

// Show the topic in the help file.  Remember to add
// the "html\" folder name and the ".htm" extension.
Help.ShowHelp(parentForm, helpFilePath,
    HelpNavigator.Topic, @"html\" + pageName + ".htm");
</pre>

<pre lang="vbnet" title="VB.NET - HashedMemberName">
' Assume memberName contains the member name of the
' topic to show.
Dim pageName As String = String.Format("{0:X}", _
    memberName.GetHashCode())

' Show the topic in the help file.  Remember to add
' the "html\" folder name and the ".htm" extension.
Help.ShowHelp(parentForm, helpFilePath, _
    HelpNavigator.Topic, "html\" & pageName & ".htm")
</pre>

<h3><a class="Reference" name="Preliminary">Preliminary</a></h3>
When this property is set to true, it will mark all topics in the help file
with a large, red message "[This is preliminary documentation and is
subject to change.]".  This is a quick and easy way to mark documentation
for beta software as preliminary and subject to change.  See the
<b>Customizing the Header and Footer Text</b> section for information on
how to change the layout of this text.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="PresentationStyle">PresentationStyle</a></h3>
This property is used to choose the presentation style that determines the
layout and appearance of the help topics.  Sandcastle comes with two
styles: <b>Prototype</b> (the default) and <b>VS2005</b>.  The files for
each style are located in the <b>.\Presentation</b> folder under the main
Sandcastle installation folder.  If you create your own styles, place the
folders in the same location and the help file builder will detect them
automatically and let you select them in the project.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="PrjLink">ProjectLinkType</a></h3>
This property is used to define the type of links used to reference other
help topics referring to items within the documented assemblies.  It can be
set to <b>None</b> which renders non-clickable links, <b>Local</b> (the
default) which renders normal links defined with anchor tags, or
<b>Index</b> which renders HTML 2.x style MS-Help links.  The <b>Index</b>
option is only useful when generating an HTML 2.x help file.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="RootNS">RootNamespaceContainer</a></h3>
This property is used to specify whether or not a root namespace entry is
added to the table of content to act as a container for the namespaces from
the documented assemblies.  If true, a root <b>Namespaces</b> table of
content entry will be created as the container of the namespaces in the
documented assemblies.  If false, the default, the namespaces are listed in
the table of content as root entries.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="SdkLink">SdkLinkType</a></h3>
This property is used to define the type of links used to reference other
help topics referring to framework (SDK) help topics.  It can be
set to <b>None</b> which renders non-clickable links, <b>Index</b> which
renders HTML 2.x style MS-Help links, or <b>MSDN</b> (the default) which
renders links to the online MSDN help content for the topic.  The
<b>Index</b> option is only useful when generating an HTML 2.x help file.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="SyntaxFilters">SyntaxFilters</a></h3>
This property lets you specify which languages appear in the <b>Syntax</b>
section of the help topics and, for the <b>Prototype</b> presentation
style, the dropdown in the upper right of the topics.  It can be set to
<code>CSharp</code>, <code>VisualBasic</code>, <code>CPlusPlus</code>,
<code>JSharp</code>, a combination of those values, <code>All</code> to
include them all, <code>Standard</code> (the default) for C#, VB.NET, and
C++ only, or to <code>None</code> to remove the <b>Syntax</b> section
entirely.
