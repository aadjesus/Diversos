<h2>Project Summary Comments</h2>
The <b>Prj Summary</b> button in the <b>Assemblies to Document</b> section
of the main form opens a form in which you can enter summary comments that
should appear in the root namespaces page of the compiled help file.  This
is the standard default page unless additional content is defined that is
marked as the default page.  The Namespaces page is also accessible via the
breadcrumb link available at the top of the namespace item help pages in
the generated help file.  These comments will appear above the list of
namespaces and can contain HTML markup (i.e. text formatting, e-mail links,
etc).  If none are defined, the page just shows the list of namespaces.

<h2>Namespace Summaries</h2>
The <b>Namespaces</b> button in the <b>Assemblies to Document</b> section
of the main form allows you to specify which namespaces should appear in
the help file and the namespace summaries to display in the root namespaces
page and on the help page for each namespace.

<p/><div align="center"><img src="../Images/Namespaces.jpg"
    alt="Namespace Summaries" width="888" height="583" /></div>

<p/>Check the namespaces that you want to appear and uncheck those that you do
not want to appear.  By default, all namespaces in all assemblies are
documented with the exception of the global (unnamed) namespace that
sometimes appears and contains private module details.

<p/>To edit a namespace summary, select the namespace in the list and edit
the comments in the text box at the bottom of the form.  The comments can
include HTML markup (i.e. bolding, e-mail links, etc).  If no summary is
defined, a red warning note will appear for the namespace on the root
namespaces page and above the namespace content in the help page for the
namespace itself.  When this form is opened, it scans the documentation
assemblies for new namespaces and adds them to the list if it finds any.
If you build a help file without updating the namespace list, any unknown
namespaces will appear in the help file but they will also contain a red
warning message indicating that the namespace summary is missing.

<p/>Namespaces are never removed from the list even if the namespace no longer
appears in one of the documented assemblies.  You can remove old namespaces
from the list by selecting them and clicking the <b>Delete</b> button.
