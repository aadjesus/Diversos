<h2>The Path Category Properties</h2>
The following properties are available in the <b>Path</b> category.  These
define the location of the tools and the output location of the help file.

<ul>
    <li><a href="#HHCPath">HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath</a></li>
    <li><a href="#HXCompPath">HtmlHelp2xCompilerPath</a></li>
    <li><a href="#OutputPath">OutputPath</a></li>
    <li><a href="#SCPath">SandcastlePath</a></li>
    <li><a href="#WorkingPath">WorkingPath</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="Reference" name="HHCPath">HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath</a></h3>
This property lets you specify the path to the HTML 1.x help compiler
(<b>HHC.EXE</b>).  By default, the builder will try to locate it
automatically by searching the Program Files special folder on all fixed
hard drives.  As such, you only need to specify the path if the build fails
with a message stating that it could not be found.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="HXCompPath">HtmlHelp2xCompilerPath</a></h3>
This property lets you specify the path to the HTML help 2.x compiler
(<b>HXCOMP.EXE</b>).  By default, the builder will try to locate it
automatically by searching the Program Files special folder on all fixed
hard drives.  As such, you only need to specify the path if the build fails
with a message stating that it could not be found.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="OutputPath">OutputPath</a></h3>
This property lets you specify where the compiled help file should be
placed.  The default is to store it in a folder called <b>.\Help\</b>
relative to the project folder.  It is also the location of the temporary
<b>.\Working\</b> folder used to store the generated build files unless it
is changed with the <code>WorkingPath</code> property.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="SCPath">SandcastlePath</a></h3>
This property lets you specify the path to Sandcastle.  By default, the
builder will try to locate it automatically by extracting its location from
the system path and, if not found there, by searching the Program Files
special folder on all fixed hard drives.  As such, you only need to specify
the path if the build fails with a message stating that it could not be
found.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="WorkingPath">WorkingPath</a></h3>
This property lets you specify an alternate location with a shorter path in
which to perform the build if it fails due to long file path names.  If
not specified, the working folder will be placed under the output path and
will be called <b>.\Working</b>.
