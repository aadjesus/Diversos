<h2>The Visibility Category Properties</h2>
The following properties are available in the <b>Visibility</b> category.
These control what appears in the help file and can reduce the help content
and get rid of unwanted items, especially when documenting internal and
private members.  Information is written to the log file detailing how each
property affected the build.

<p/><b><u>Known Limitations:</u></b>  When the <b>DocumentInternals</b>,
<b>DocumentPrivates</b>, and/or <b>DocumentPrivateFields</b> options are
set to true, the class members help pages will include many members
belonging to the base .NET Framework classes.  Since no visibility
information is available for them, they cannot be removed automatically
based on the property settings. If you do not wish to see them, set the
<b>DocumentInheritedFrameworkMembers</b> property to false.  A similar
situation exists when the <b>DocumentProtected</b> or
<b>DocumentSealedProtected</b> properties are set to false.  Because no
visibility information is available, the protected members are still listed
in the class members help pages.  As above, if you do not want to see them,
set the <b>DocumentInheritedFrameworkMembers</b> property to false.

</ul>

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocAttrs">DocumentAttributes</a></h3>
When set to false, the default, the help builder will strip all attribute
information from the documented items so that they do not appear in the
syntax section of each class, property, method, etc. in the compiled help
file. When set to true, the attribute information is left intact and will
appear in the help file.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocEII">DocumentExplicitInterfaceImplementations</a></h3>
When set to false, the default, explicit interface implementations are
removed from the help file.  This includes explicit implementations in base
classes so that they do not appear in the class members help pages.  Set
this property to true to include them in the help file.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocInhMem">DocumentInheritedMembers</a></h3>
When set to true, the default, all inherited members of the class are
listed in the class members help page.  When set to false, all inherited
members including inherited .NET Framework class members are removed from
the class members help pages.  This can be useful when documenting internal
or private members to help reduce clutter.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocFrmwkMem">DocumentInheritedFrameworkMembers</a></h3>
When set to true, the default, all inherited .NET Framework members of the
class (any member starting with "<b>System.</b>" or "<b>Microsoft.</b>")
are listed in the class members help pages.  When set to false, all
inherited .NET Framework class members are removed from the class members
help pages.  This can be useful when documenting internal or private members
to help reduce clutter.  For this option to work,
<b>DocumentInheritedMembers</b> must also be set to true.  When it is set to
false, framework members are removed by default.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocInternals">DocumentInternals</a></h3>
When set to false, the default, the help builder will not document any
internal (Friend) members of classes in the documentation assemblies. When
true, the help builder will add the <b>/internal+</b> command line option
to <b>MRefBuilder</b> so that it does include documentation for internal
class members.  Because they share a similar visibility, <b>protected
internal</b> members will be left in the help file when this is set to true
even if the <b>DocumentProtected</b> property is set to false.  Also note
that this property works independently of the <b>DocumentPrivates</b>
property below.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocPrvFlds">DocumentPrivateFields</a></h3>
When set to false, the default, the help builder will not document any
private fields of classes in the documentation assemblies.  Since most
private fields back properties or represent items such as controls on
forms, they usuually do not have comments and can significantly clutter the
resulting help file with unwanted entries.  Leaving this option set to
false can eliminate the problem.  When set to true, the private fields are
included in the help file.  To work, the <b>DocumentPrivates</b> property
must also be set to true.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocPrivates">DocumentPrivates</a></h3>
When set to false, the default, the help builder will not document any
private members of classes in the documentation assemblies.
When true, the help builder will add the <b>/internal+</b> command line
option to <b>MRefBuilder</b> so that it does include documentation for
private class members.  Also note that this property works independently of
the <b>DocumentInternals</b> property above.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocProt">DocumentProtected</a></h3>
When set to true, the default, the help builder will document all
<b>protected</b> and <b>protected internal</b> members of classes in the
documentation assemblies. When false, the help builder will remove them
from the help file.  Because they share a similar visibility, <b>protected
internal</b> members will be left in the help file when the
<b>DocumentInternals</b> property is set to true even if this property is
set to false.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocProtInt">DocumentProtectedInternalAsProtected</a></h3>
When set to false, the default, the help builder will document all
<b>protected internal</b> members of classes in the documentation assemblies
without modification.  When true, the help builder will alter <b>protected
internal</b> members so that they are listed as <b>protected</b> only in
the help file.  If <b>DocumentProtected</b> is set to false, this option is
ignored.

<h3><a class="Reference" name="DocSealed">DocumentSealedProtected</a></h3>
When set to true, the default, the help builder will document all protected
members of sealed classes in the documentation assemblies. When false, the
help builder will remove all protected members from sealed classes so that
they do not appear in the help file.  To work, the <b>DocumentProtected</b>
property must also be set to true.
