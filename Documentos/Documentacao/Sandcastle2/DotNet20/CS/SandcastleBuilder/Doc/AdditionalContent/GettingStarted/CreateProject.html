<h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
On the <b>Project</b> menu, you can select one of the following options to
begin a new help file project:

<dl>
    <dt>New Project</dt>
    <dd>Select this option to begin a new project from scratch.  The project
properties are reset to their default values.  See below for information on
adding assemblies and building the project.</dd>
    <dt>New Project from NDoc Project</dt>
    <dd>If you are converting from NDoc to Sandcastle, you can use this
option to import the settings from an NDoc 1.3 project file.  The
documentation assembly information, namespace summaries, additional
content, and many other project properties are imported and converted to
the matching Sandcastle Help File Builder properties.  Once imported, review
the imported information and make any necessary adjustments.</dd>
    <dt>New Project form Visual Studio Project</dt>
    <dd>This option allows you to start a brand new help file project and
automatically import the documentation assembly information from a Visual
Studio 2003/2005 solution (.sln) or project file (.*proj).  In order to
work, the projects must contain a .NET assembly (C#, VB.NET, or J#) as
output and must have the XML documentation file option enabled with a
documentation filename specified.  If a solution file is selected, all
assembly information that meets the requirements is imported from all
projects within the solution.  If a single project file is selected, only
the information from that project will be imported.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Modifying the Project Options</h3>
The <b>Assemblies to Document</b> section at the top of the main form lists
the assemblies and comment files that will be documented by the project.
To work with the assemblies, use the buttons to the right of the list:

<ul>
    <li>Click <b>Add</b> to add one or more assemblies to the list.  A File
Open dialog box appears in which you can select one or more DLLs,
executables, or XML files associated with the items to document.  When
adding a DLL or an executable, if an XML comments file with the same name
is found, it is associated with the assembly automatically.  Likewise, if
you select an XML comments file a DLL or executable with a matching name is
associated with it automatically.  If the matching file cannot be
determined, it is set to "Unknown" and you can edit the entry to correct
it.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> to edit the filenames for the selected entry.  A
new dialog box appears that lets you specify the paths to the two files.
Both must be specified.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Remove</b> to remove an entry.</li>
</ul>

See the <a href="../GUIProject/NamespaceSummaries.html">Project and Namespace
Summaries</a> topic for information on setting the project and namespace
level summary text and how to limit which namespaces are documented.

<p/>The center section of the form contains a property grid that displays
the project options.  The options are grouped into several categories and
are listed alphabetically within them.  More information on the properties
can be found in <a href="../GUIProject/GUIProject.html">The GUI Project
Manager</a> section.  Modify each property to suit your needs.

<h3>Building the Help File</h3>
Use the <b>Build Project</b> option on the <b>Documentation</b> menu to
build the help file using the current settings.  If this is a new, unsaved
project, you will be prompted to save the project file first.  This is
required so that the build process can properly resolve any relative paths
within the project. The bottom section of the form contains an output
window that will display the messages from the build process as it runs.
When completed, the <b>View Output in Window</b> option on the
<b>Documentation</b> menu can be used to open a resizable window to more
easily view the build log output.  The <b>View Help File</b> option on the
<b>Documentation</b> menu will allow you to view the help file that was
built.  Note that this only works for HTML Help 1.x and web site output.
HTML Help 2.x files require a separate viewer.  See the <a
href="../Links.html">Links to Resources</a> topic for information on how to
obtain it.
