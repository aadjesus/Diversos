<h2>Absolute and Relative Paths</h2>
In the form that lets you edit the assembly and XML comment filenames and
for the path-related properties in the project, you can enter absolute
paths or relative paths.  When using the designer popups (accessed by
clicking the "..." button to the right of the filename/folder value in the
property grid when it is selected), absolute paths are always returned.
However, you can edit the returned path to make it a relative path.  The
key point to remember is that the help file builders (both the GUI and
console version) always expect that relative paths are relative to either
the folder in which the project file is saved or to the working folder used
for the build.  The expected relative location will be noted in the
description of each affected property.  A typical folder layout is shown
here:

<pre>
C:\HelpTest\        Solution folder.
  |
  +-TestAssembly    Application project folder.
  | |
  | +-Bin
  |   |
  |   +-Release     Location of assembly and comment files.
  |
  +-Doc             Help file builder project location.
    |
    |
    +-Help          The output folder for the help file.
      |
      +-Working     The intermediate working folder used
        |           during the build.
        |
        +-DLL       Dependencies folder for MRefBuilder
        |           (if needed).
        |
        +-Output    Help file project compilation folder.
          +-art
          +-html
          +-scripts
          +-styles
</pre>

The example above places the help file builder project in the
<i>C:\HelpTest\Doc\</i> folder.  As such, the relative path to the assembly
that will be documented and its comment file is
<i>..\TestAssembly\Bin\Release\</i>.  The default output folder for a project
is always <i>.\Help\</i>.  If you would prefer the help file to end up in a
different location, you can modify it using the <code>OutputPath</code>
property.
