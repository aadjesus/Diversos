<h2>Setting Up Your Projects</h2>
In order to create a help file with the help file builder, you must enable
XML comments in your projects so that an XML file is generated to contain
them when the project is built.  This is done as follows:

<ul>
    <li>In the Solution Explorer, right click on the project and select
<b>Properties</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Build</b> property page.</li>
    <li>The XML comments file name is a configuration option.  As such,
you can either select the <b>All Configurations</b> option at the top of the
page to set the XML comments options for all configurations at the same time
or select each configuration individually and repeat the next step for each
one.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Output</b> section, check the checkbox next to the <b>Xml
documentation file</b>  text box and specify a name for the XML file.
Although not required, a common convention is to name the XML comments file
after the related assembly (except with a <b>.xml</b> extension).  The
assembly name can be found on the <b>Application</b> property page.</li>
    <li>If you have a solution with multiple projects that need to be
documented, repeat the above steps for each project in the solution.
</ul>

Once the above has been done, Visual Studio will create the XML comments file
each time the project is built.  If you are not using the Visual Studio IDE,
be sure to add the <b>/doc</b> command line option when compiling your
source files.

<h3>Decorating Your Code</h3>
In addition to setting the project option to create the file, you must also
add XML comments to your source code.  Visual Studio 2005 supports XML
comments in both C# and VB.NET.  At a minimum, you should add a
<code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag to each public type and to the public and
protected members of those types.  There are many other tags available that
will help improve the quality of your documentation.

<p/>For more information on XML comments and how to use them, see either
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7.aspx" target="_blank">XML
Documentation Comments (C# Programming Guide)</a> or
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172652.aspx" target="_blank">Documenting
Your Code with XML (Visual Basic)</a>.

<p/>Although not documented, you can use HTML markup within your XML comments
to provide additional formatting, embed images, etc.  See the
<a href="../FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for more information.

<h3>Setting Up Visual Studio to Open a Project File</h3>
<p/>The help file builder project can be added to the solution file so that
it can be checked into source control or opened from within Visual Studio.
I like to add it as a solution item by right clicking on the solution name
in the Solution Explorer, selecting <b>Add | Existing Item</b>, and then
selecting the help file builder project.  It is then added to a <b>Solution
Items</b> folder in your solution.

<p/>You can also have Visual Studio open the help file builder project
using the GUI tool rather than its default text editor.  To do so, right
click on the help file builder project and select <b>Open With...</b>.
Click <b>Add</b> to add a new program to the list. Enter the path to
<b>SandcastleBuilderGUI.exe</b> for your system and enter something like
"Sandcastle Help File Builder" for the friendly name.  Click <b>OK</b> to
save it, and then click <b>Set as Default</b> to make it the default tool
for opening the help file builder projects.  Click <b>OK</b> to save it.
Now, whenever you double-click the help file builder project, it will open
in the GUI tool automatically.
