<h2>Creating Language Resource Files</h2>
The language resource files are located in a sub-folder beneath the
<i>.\LanguageResources</i> folder in the installation location for the
Sandcastle Help File Builder.  The sub-folders are named using the value
returned by the <code>CultureInfo.Name</code> property (i.e. en-US, fr-FR,
de-DE).  There are three XML files:

<ul>
    <li><b>reference_content.xml</b> contains titles for the various class
library parts, filter text, and alternate image text.</li>
    <li><b>shared_content.xml</b> contains paths to the shared content (art,
scripts, and style sheets), code section labels, and customizable text for
the header and footer in each page.
    <li><b>syntax_content.xml</b> contains some programming language
limitation messages.</li>
</ul>

To create resource files for a new language, create a new folder beneath
the <i>.\LanguageResource</i> folder and name it using the culture name as
described above.  If you are not sure what to name the folder, go to the <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_238z.asp"
target="_blank">Locale Identifier Constants and Strings</a> MSDN topic and
locate the locale that you need.  The locale name column contains the value
to use for the folder name.  Once the folder is created, copy the three
files from the <i>.\en-US</i> folder and modify the text for your selected
language.  If people are kind enough to supply additional translated files,
I'll add them to a later release.

<p/>How the files are encoded is very important if they contain extended
characters.  To ensure that the help file builder and the Sandcastle tools
properly interpret the encoding within the files, it is best to save the
files such that they contain byte order marks at the start of the file for
Unicode encoded formats as well as an XML header tag that specifies the
correct encoding. In the absence of byte order marks, the encoding in the
XML header tag ensures that the file is still interpreted correctly.  The
supplied default language resource files contain examples of this.

<p/>When using entities to represent special characters in the XML language
resource files or in the header text, copyright text, etc, use the numeric
form rather than the name form as the XML parser will not recognize them
and will throw an exception.  For example, if you specify
<code>&amp;Auml;</code> (Latin capital letter A with diaeresis) an exception
will be generated.  To fix it, use the numeric form instead
(<code>&amp;#196;</code>).  This also applies for symbols such as
<code>&amp;copy;</code> in the copyright text. Instead, you should use
<code>&amp;#169;</code> to get the copyright symbol.
