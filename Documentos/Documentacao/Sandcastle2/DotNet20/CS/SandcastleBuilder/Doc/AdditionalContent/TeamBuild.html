<h2>Generating Documentation with Team Build</h2>
The following information was supplied by Tim Dallmann in the MSDN
Developer Documentation and Help System forum and provides details on how
to use Team Build in conjunction with Sandcastle and the help file builder
to generate help files.

<h3>The General Concept</h3>
The Sandcastle Help File Builder includes both a GUI for editing documentation
generation properties on the client as well as a console application for
running from the build script on the server.  The project file that the
GUI creates can be added to a Visual Studio solution and therefore can be
added to source control.  The output from Sandcastle can be copied
with the build script to any location you like.  For example, it can be
copied to Team Foundation Server and a link to it can be placed on the team's
project site.

<h3>The Process</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Download and install Sandcastle, the HTML Help Workshop, and the
Sandcastle Help File Builder on your development machine and your build
server.</li>

    <li>Run the Sandcastle Help File builder and create a new project.
Save it in the root folder of your solution.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Add your assemblies and use relative paths (the default) so
that they are relative to the help file project folder.  You will need to
use the copies from the solution's Release folder or it will not work on
your build server.</li>

        <li>Add any dependencies.  Again, make sure the paths are relative
to the help file project folder.</li>

        <li>Specify the paths to all of the help tools in the help file
project's <b>Paths</b> category. It may run without them on your
workstation but it will not work on the build server.</li>

        <li>Set all other project properties as needed.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Add the generated <b>.shfb</b> project file to your Visual Studio
solution and check it in.</li>

    <li>Modify your build file.  This example uses a daily build to
generate documentation:

    <ul>
        <li>Add a <code>PackageBinaries</code> target to your build script.
This target was chosen because it happens after all building and testing is
completed.  This will call the Sandcastle Help File Builder console
application to create the help files:

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
&lt;Target Name="PackageBinaries"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Build source code docs --&gt;
  &lt;Exec Command="&amp;quot;C:\Program Files\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe&amp;quot; &amp;quot;$(SolutionRoot)\src\MyProjectHelp.shfb&amp;quot;" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</pre>

    Note that version 1.4.0.0 and later of the help file builder support setting
project options from the command line as well.  See the
<a href="ConsoleApp.html">Console Mode Builder</a> help topic for details.</li>

        <li>Add an <code>AfterDropBuild</code> target to your build script
to copy all the new help files to a web server:

<pre lang="xml" title=" ">
&lt;Target Name="AfterDropBuild"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Delete old source code docs --&gt;
  &lt;CreateItem Include="\\tfsserver\Code Documentation\MyProject\**\*.*"&gt;
    &lt;Output TaskParameter="Include" ItemName="DocDeployFiles" /&gt;
  &lt;/CreateItem&gt;
  &lt;Delete Files="@(DocDeployFiles)" /&gt;

  &lt;!-- Copy new source code docs to team system --&gt;
  &lt;CreateItem Include="$(SolutionRoot)\src\Help\**\*.*"
      Exclude="$(SolutionRoot)\src\Help\Working\**\*.*"&gt;
    &lt;Output TaskParameter="Include" ItemName="NewDocFiles" /&gt;
  &lt;/CreateItem&gt;
  &lt;Copy SourceFiles="@(NewDocFiles)"
    DestinationFolder="\\tfsserver\Code Documentation\MyProject\%(NewDocFiles.RecursiveDir)" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</pre>

    <b>Note:</b> You do not need the <code>Exclude</code> attribute for the
<code>NewDocFiles</code> property if you set the help file project's
<code>CleanIntermediates</code> property to true.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>Add a new web share to your destination server (i.e. the Team
Foundation Server) called <b>CodeDocumentation</b>.

    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the folder properties grant full access to the process
user running the build (<b>TFSBuild</b> for example).</li>

        <li>Add <b>Index.html</b> to the default documents for the site.</li>

        <li>Place a subfolder within this folder for the project
documentation.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>Check in your build script and run it.
</ol>

You should now have fresh documentation available every day.  You can also
set up a separate build using a different name that allows you to create
new documentation during the day without running all the other items in the
daily build.  This can be useful if someone adds a lot of new documentation
into the code that you want to make available immediately.
