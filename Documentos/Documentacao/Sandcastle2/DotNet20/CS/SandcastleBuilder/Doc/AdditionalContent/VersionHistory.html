    <td>v1.4.0.0 - Changes made in this release:
<ul>
    <li>Added support for the March 2007 CTP of Sandcastle.</li>
    <li><b>NOTE:</b> The default configurations for the
<code>CodeBlockComponent</code> and <code>PostTransformComponent</code>
have changed and <b><u>must be reset</u></b> and reconfigured if you
customized them via the <code>ComponentConfigurations</code> project
option.  Line numbering and outlining are now off by default.  A new option
"Connect code blocks to language filter" has been added to allow connecting
the code blocks to the language filter.  If enabled (the default), code
blocks are shown or hidden based on the language filter setting.  If
disabled, code blocks are always shown regardless of the language filter
setting.  Options are also present to set the location of the "Copy" image
and the file path for it.</li>

    <li>Made some significant performance improvements.  Build times in some
cases involving extremely large numbers of topics can be reduced by up to
50% or more.  The larger the number of topics to document, the more significant
the decrease in build time.
    <ul>
        <li>Optimized loading and saving of the reflection information file
and the XML comments files within the build engine.</li>

        <li>Optimized the purge item code and duplicate checking in the
name generation code to eliminate unnecessary XPath lookups.</li>

        <li>The processing for the <code>ShowMissing*</code> options has
been moved into a new build component (<code>ShowMissingComponent</code>).
On extremely large documentation builds (tens of thousands of topics), the
XPath queries that were used to look up the member comments and the
information in the reflection file took an extremely long time.  By moving
the processing to a build component, the amount of information to search is
greatly reduced and the time to add missing item comments is now
negligible.</li>

        <li>The version information lookup part of the
<code>PostTransformComponent</code> was split out into a new
<code>VersionInfoComponent</code> that runs before transformation of the
topic occurs.  This allows for an optimized lookup of the version
information and the whole reflection file does not need to be loaded thus
reducing memory usage for large builds and speeding up the searches for
version information.</li>

        <li>Added build step timing information so that it is easier to see
which steps are taking the longest during a build.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>The console mode builder can now accept project properties as
command line options to override or add settings to a project.  A response
file can also be used to avoid problems with long command lines.  See the
<a href="ConsoleApp.html"/>Console Mode Builder</a> topic for details.</li>

    <li>Added the <code>WorkingPath</code> property so that you can specify
an alternate location with a shorter path in which to perform the build if
it fails due to long file path names.</li>

    <li>The following file and folder project properties have been
converted from strings to objects.  This allows them to be persisted as
paths relative to the current project location rather than as absolute
paths at your choosing.  In addition, environment variables such as
<code>%DXROOT%</code>, <code>%WINDIR%</code>, etc. can be specified in the
paths and they will be expanded at build time to the value of the specified
environment variable. Properties affected:<br/><br/>

    <ul>
        <li>SandcastleProject.HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath</li>
        <li>SandcastleProject.HtmlHelp2xCompilerPath</li>
        <li>SandcastleProject.SandcastlePath</li>
        <li>SandcastleProject.WorkingPath</li>
        <li>DocumentAssembly.AssemblyPath</li>
        <li>DocumentAssembly.XmlCommentsPath</li>
        <li>ContentItem.SourcePath</li>
        <li>DependencyItem.DependencyPath</li>
    </ul>

<p/>The <code>OutputPath</code> property is still a string.  If relative,
it is always relative to the project folder and thus should not point at
the prior location if the project is saved in a new folder.  For similar
reasons, the <code>DestinationPath</code> property of additional content
items has also been left as a string.</li>

<p/>All fully qualified paths in the affected properties in projects
created by prior versions of the help file builder will become relative
paths automatically when opened in the latest version.  If you need a fixed
path, expand the property and set the <code>IsFixedPath</code> property to
true so that it is saved as an absolute rather than a relative path.</li>

    <li>It is now possible to resolve project option values and shared
content items in additional content files.  See the
<a href="GUIProject/AddContent/SharedContent.html">Project Properties
and Shared Content</a> help topic in the
<a href="GUIProject/AddContent/AddContent.html">Additional Content Settings</a>
section for details.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug in the code to resolve links to namespace content from
additional content that caused it to add too many relative path parts to
the URLs.  Fixed a bug that caused it to miss the default page setting if
the page was associated with a folder.  Also fixed a bug that caused it to
ignore the page if it was associated with a folder and it was the only
file in the folder.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug in the code colorizer caused by the description for the
collapsed region not being HTML encoded.  Also fixed up the definitions so
that it doesn't colorize preprocessor text within quotes and comments and
handles XML attribute names containing colons.</li>

    <li>Fixed the <code>CodeBlockComponent</code> and the code colorizer so
that they recognize VB.NET style <code>#Else If</code>, <code>#End
If</code>, and <code>#End Region</code> statements.</li>

    <li>The code colorizer now renders a "Copy" icon and text to the right
of each title line on the code blocks and allows you to copy the code to
the clipboard.  The code is copied as plain text without the highlighting
and line numbers if used. Default titles are also used on code block that
do not have a title.  The default title is based on the language specified.</li>

    <li>Modified the the C++ comments fixup code so that it only strips out
the unnecessary characters if they appear in a declaration involving the
<code>System.Collections.Generic</code> namespace.</li>

    <li>The <code>PresentationStyle</code> property now uses a type
converter that allows you to select any folder under the
<b>.\Presentation</b> folder in the main Sandcastle installation folder.
This allows you to create custom versions of the Prototype and VS2005
styles using different names and select them for use from within a help
file builder project.

    <li>The build process now tries to delete the help file first if it
exists so that it stops immediately if the help file is open and cannot be
overwritten.</li>

    <li>Made the file extension checks case-insensitive when adding
assemblies and comments files to the project and when examining additional
content files during the build.</li>

    <li>When documenting internals, private fields backing events are now
removed as they can never be documented with comments.</li>

    <li>Removed extraneous paragraph tags from the formatted footer
replacement tag values.</li>

    <li>Modified the <code>comments</code> shared content item so that the
e-mail link in the page footers now appends the current topic's title to
the help file's title for the e-mail's subject.</li>

    <li>Added a <b>FooterText</b> property to the project that lets you add
additional text to the footer of each page without having to modify the
shared content file.  The text is inserted at the start of the
<code>footer</code> shared content item.</li>

    <li>The post-transform component now turns off all file attributes when
copying the highlighter and logo files so that they can be deleted at the
end of the build when <code>CleanIntermediates</code> is set to true.</li>

    <li>Added <code>placement</code> and <code>alignment</code> attributes
to the <code>logoFile</code> element of the post-transform component.  This
allows the logo to be placed to the left, right, or above the topic title.
When placed above the topic title, it can be aligned to the left or right
or centered.

    <li>Moved the version information text to the end of the location
information shared content items.  The <code>PostTransformComponent</code>
now moves the location/version text to the end of the footer in the
Prototype style.</li>

    <li>Added a <b>Delete</b> button to the <b>Namespaces</b> dialog that
lets you remove old namespaces from the list that no longer appear in the
assemblies.</li>

    <li>Added <code>Help1xAndHelp2x</code> and
<code>Help1xAnd2xAndWebsite</code> options to the <code>HelpFileFormat</code>
project option.

    <li>Added an <code>ExcludeItems</code> property to the additional
content items.  If set to true, the file or files matching the source path
are excluded.  If used with a wildcard source path, all matching files in
sub-folders are excluded as well.</li>

    <li>Thanks to Dessiatov Anton for providing Russian translations for
the language resource files.  See the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for a fix
that must be made to one of the Sandcastle transformations for the HTML
content in order to work with them correctly.</li>

    <td>v1.3.3.1 - Changes made in this release:
<ul>
    <li><b><u>NOTE TO VERSION 1.3.3.0 RC USERS:</u></b>  You
<b><u>must</u></b> reset the <b>Post-transform Component</b> configuration
and reconfigure it before performing a build with this release due to
changes in the configuration.</li>

    <li>Updated for use with the December 2006 CTP.  A patch file for the
Sandcastle style and transformation files is supplied separately to fix
missing support for <b>br</b> and <b>hr</b> tags in the Prototype style, to
fixed numbered lists, and to add support for displaying the "Obsolete"
messages on obsolete items. Extract the patch to your Sandcastle
installation folder.  See the ReadMe.txt file included with it for details
on the fixes that I made.</li>
    <li>Implemented a code block custom build component with the following
features:
    <ul>
        <li>Syntax highlighting of code blocks in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
tags. Languages supported: C#, VB.NET, C++, C, JavaScript, VBScript, J#, and
XML.</li>

        <li>Excess leading whitespace is stripped from the
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks to left align them correctly.</li>

        <li>Support for optional line numbering.</li>

        <li>Support for optional collapsible regions for code in #region
and #if/#else/#endif blocks with support for nested collapsible regions.</li>

        <li>Support for reading in an external source file or a defined
region of an external source file so that you can keep code samples in a
buildable project to test for correctness and do away with managing the
code samples in the XML comments and include files.</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li>Implemented a post-transform custom build component with the following
features:
    <ul>
        <li>Companion to the Code Block Component to add the supporing
links for the colorizer script and stylesheet.</li>

        <li>It can insert a logo image at the top of each help topic.</li>

        <li>For the Prototype style, it hides the language combo box if
only one language appears in the Syntax section.</li>

        <li>Version information will be added to the help topics if used with
the help file builder.  If used outside the help file builder, a modification
is required to the Sandcastle reference content files.</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li>Added support for the XML comments <code>&lt;exclude/&gt;</code>
tag.</li>

    <li>Added the <code>locale</code> attribute to the
<code>ResolveReferenceLinksComponent</code> in <b>sandcastle.config</b> to
use the project language for the MSDN URLs.  Note that there is a small bug
in the component that causes the first reference to still point to the
English site.  This bug has been reported and will hopefully be fixed in
the next Sandcastle CTP.</li>

    <li>The build components are configured individually via the new
project option <code>ComponentConfigurations</code>.  Additional third
party build components can be plugged into the help file builder by adding
the default configuration to the sandcastle.config template with a unique
ID attribute and implementing a public static <code>ConfigureComponent</code>
method in the component.  See the help file for more details.</li>

    <li>Added a <code>SyntaxFilters</code> property that lets you specify
which languages appear in the Syntax section of the help topics and, for
the Prototype presentation style, the dropdown in the upper right of the
topics.  It can be set to CSharp, VisualBasic, CPlusPlus, JSharp, a
combination of those values, All to include them all, Standard (the
default) for C#, VB.NET, and C++ only, or to None to remove the Syntax
section entirely.</li>

    <li>Added the <code>CppCommentsFixup</code> project property to work
around an issue with methods that take generics as parameters in XML
comments files created by the C++ compiler (it doesn't match the other .NET
compilers' naming conventions).</li>

    <li>The <code>FrameworkVersion</code> property is now always saved in
the project to prevent building against the wrong version when a project is
edited on two different systems, one with a more recent version of .NET
than another.  It also defaults to .NET 2.0 for new projects rather than
the most recent framework version on the system which may be .NET 3.0
to prevent unexpected problems.  If you need .NET 3.0, you must select it
manually.</li>

    <li>The <code>HelpTitle</code> property is now displayed in the help
topics at the top of the page where "Reference Library" used to be.</li>

    <li>The <code>ObsoleteAttribute</code>, <code>FlagsAttribute</code>,
and <code>SerializableAttribute</code> are now always included even if
<code>DocumentAttributes</code> is set to false. These provide useful
information and should not be filtered out.</li>

    <li>The <b>Preview and Arrange</b> dialog for additional content no
longer prompts for the project folder as it is maintained internally now.</li>

    <li>Code in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags in additional content HTML
files can be colorized by adding the colorizer attributes to them.  See the
<b>Syntax Highlighting &lt;pre&gt; Tag Content</b> topic for details.</li>

    <li>Modified the tool search to also try to find Sandcastle via the
<code>DXROOT</code> environment variable.</li>

    <td>v1.3.2.0 - Changes made in this release:
<ul>
    <li>Updated for use with the November 2006 CTP.  A patch file for the
Sandcastle style and transformation files is supplied separately to fix a
few issues that still remain with the stock versions supplied with
Sandcastle.  Extract the patch to your Sandcastle installation folder.  See
the ReadMe.txt file included with it for details on the fixes that I
made.</li>
    <li>Converted the Common Problems and Solutions help file topic into a
FAQ topic and added several more items to it.  A toolbar button and a
Help menu option where added to give easy access to it from the help file
builder.</li>
    <li>Added the ability to add XML comments files without an associated
assembly. This is useful for adding shared project summary or namespace
summary comments to multiple projects without having to store the comments
in the Sandcastle Help File Builder project.  See the help file for
details.</li>
    <li>Paths to non-GAC dependency items can now be edited in the
Dependency Item Editor dialog box so that you can make them have relative
paths.</li>
    <li>Added an <b>MRefBuilder.config</b> template that is used to tell
MRefBuilder which framework comments to use based on the project's
<code>FrameworkVersion</code> property.  It is now possible to correctly
document .NET 1.0 and 1.1 assemblies.</li>
    <li>Added a new <code>NamingMethod</code> property that lets you
specify how the help topic filenames are created (GUID, member name, or
hashed member name). The last two make it easy to link to help topics from
external applications or web pages.  See the help file for more
information.</li>
    <li>Changed the build process to release the assembly loader
immediately after copying dependencies to prevent the lease running out and
causing an exception when trying to release it when done after a very long
build.</li>
    <li>The assembly loader was modified to add dependencies using a full
path so that it can find them correctly.</li>
    <li>Changed the <b>Index.html</b> template so that forward slashes are
used in the default topic page's path rather than backslashes.</li>
    <li>To prevent Out of Memory exceptions on extremely large builds, the
<code>BuildProcess</code> class now writes messages to the log file for
itself.  A Verbose Logging option was also added to the Documentation menu
in the GUI help file builder to prevent the problem as well.  If disabled,
only build step messages are logged to the output window during the build.
This is an application user setting, not a project property.</li>
    <li>Fixed the <code>ShowMissingSummaries</code> option so that if it is
set to false and <code>AutoDocumentConstructors</code> is set to true, it
does not add the unwanted "Missing Summary" text on methods, properties,
etc.</li>
    <li>Modified the tool searches so that if the "(x86)" version of the
Program Files folder exists (64-bit Windows), it searches in there instead
for Sandcastle and the help compilers.  If multiple copies are found in the
SDK folders, it now tries to return the latest SDK version.</li>
    <li>Fixed the search for Sandcastle in the PATH environment variable so
that if the help file builder path is ahead of the Sandcastle path, it
ignores it.  It will also search the VS2005 SDK folders if not found anywhere
else.</li>

versions supplied with Sandcastle.  Extract the patch to your Sandcastle
installation folder.  See the ReadMe.txt file included with it for details
on the fixes that I made.</li>
    <li>The UTF-8 encoding is now preserved on XML comments files when
adding the missing documentation tags.  They lack an encoding attribute and
byte order marks but are UTF-8 encoded and are now always treated as such
to preserve the encodings on extended characters in the authored comments.</li>
    <li>If <code>DocumentAttributes</code> is set to false, the
<code>[Serializable]</code> attributes are removed from the syntax section
now as well.</li>
    <li>Implemented several new <code>Document*</code> properties that
behave like the matching NDoc properties.  See the <b>Visibility Category

    <li>Fixed a bug that caused the website build to fail if generic
classes were in the documented assemblies due to the angle brackets in
their names.</li>
    <li>Added the <b>Show Missing Tags</b> category properties to insert
"missing documentation" messages to flag items that need attention.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Improved the help file.  The article was getting rather long so I
have moved a lot of the information to the help file and expanded on it as
needed to make it more useful.  See it for more information on how to use
the help file builder.</li>
    <li>Added <code>Website</code>, <code>Help1xAndWebsite</code>, and
<code>Help2xAndWebsite</code> options to the <code>HelpFileFormat</code>
property to allow generating the help as a website, a website plus an
HTML Help 1.x file, or a website plus an HTML Help 2.x file.  The website
output includes an index page complete with tree view for navigating the
table of content.</li>
    <li>The <code>ContentItem</code> class's <code>IsDefaultPage</code> and
<code>ContentDescription</code> properties have been removed as they are
now obtained along with a sort order while copying the additional content
items and building table of content entries for them.  See
<b>The Additional Content Property</b> topic for more information on the new
features.</li>
    <li>Added a preview option to the Additional Content editor dialog box
to preview the table of content entries for the additional content.  You can
also arrange items and set the default topic from it.</li>
    <li>Added the ability to create links to namespace help content from
the additional content files.  See the <b>Linking to
Namespace Content</b> topic for more information.</li>
    <li>Modified the file I/O code to detect the encoding of the files when
reading them and to use the same encoding when writing them back out to
preserve the character encodings within the files.</li>
    <li>The table of content file for HTML Help 1.x files is now saved
using the default encoding based on the system's code page rather than
UTF-8 encoding to ensure that the character encodings are correctly
interpretted by the help compiler and viewer.</li>
    <li>Some additional notes regarding encoding have been added to the
information on how to create language resource files for other languages.</li>
    <li>Added a command to the <b>Documentation</b> menu to clear the
output window on the main form.  The <b>View Log</b> form now loads the log
text from the last build's log file.
    <li>Added a version check on <b>MRefBuilder.exe</b> to ensure that a
valid version is being used.  An exception is thrown if the version found
is less than the expected version (you need to update Sandcastle).  A
warning is issued if the version found is greater than the expected version
(you need to update the help file builder).</li>
    <li>The <b>New Project from Visual Studio Project</b> option now
recognizes VB.NET and J# solution files.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused assembly loading to fail under certain
circumstances when determining namespaces for the <b>Namespace
Summaries</b> dialog box.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused the build process to try and scan a drive that
didn't exist when looking for the HTML Help 2.x compiler.</li>
    <li>The <code>Language</code> property now only shows the list of
languages for which resource files exist.</li>
    <li>Thanks to Olaf Rittig for the German translation of the language
resource files.</li>

    <td>v1.2.0.0 - Changes made in this release:
<ul>
    <li>A new <b>Prj Summary</b> button appears on the main form in the
Assemblies to Document section.  It opens a form in which you can enter
summary comments that should appear in the root namespaces page of the
compiled help file.</li>
    <li>A new <b>Namespaces</b> button appears on the main form that allows
you to specify which assemblies should appear in the help file and the
namespace summaries to display in the root namespaces page and on the help
page for each namespace.  By default, all namespaces in all assemblies are
documented with the exception of the global (unnamed) namespace that
sometimes appears and contains private module details.</li>
    <li>The <b>Add</b> button used to add an assembly to document now opens
a file selection dialog in which you can select one or more assemblies,
executables, or comments files to document.  It will assume that the
matching file (assembly or comments file) has the same name as the selected
file.  If a match is not found, the missing file's name is set to "Unknown"
and the <b>Edit</b> option can be used to fix it.</li>
    <li>The dependencies editor now allows the selection of a GAC item.
This allows you to specify a dependency that only resides in the GAC and
has no copy that resides elsewhere.  At build-time, the GAC is queried and
the necessary assembly is copied to the working folder for use by
MRefBuilder.</li>
    <li>Added the <code>ContentPlacement</code> property that allows you to
specify whether the additional content goes in ahead of the namespaces or
after the namespaces in the table of content.</li>
    <li>Added the <code>IsDefaultPage</code> property to the
<code>ContentItem</code> class that allows you to indicate whether or not
the content item is the default page.  If no item is marked as the default
page, the root namespaces page is used as the default page.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused the <code>RootNamespaceContainer</code>
property to be ignored if there was no additional content defined.</li>
    <li>Fixed up issues in various properties related to ampersands causing
exceptions because they cannot be interpreted by the .NET XML parser.  The
values are now HTML or URL encoded as needed.</li>
    <li>The value of the <code>CopyrightText</code> property is now treated
as plain text.  It will be HTML encoded where necessary to resolve issues
related to the ampersand and the .NET XML parser.  In addition, you can
encode special characters such as the copyright symbol using an escaped hex
value (i.e. &copy; = \xA9).</li>
    <li>Reworked the "run process" code so that it now reports progress as
the tools are running rather than at the end after the tool completes.
This gives more immediate feedback especially during long running builds so
that you can see that it is still alive.  It also captures the standard
error stream output so that if a tool throws an exception, that information
is now captured in the log file as well.  Where appropriate, the name of
the script being executed is also logged.</li>
    <li>Increased the font size in the log viewer dialog box to 10pt so
that it is easier to read.</li>
    <li>Path-related properties are now grouped in a new <b>Paths</b>
category in the property grid on the main form.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio 2003 projects are now loaded using the default encoding
rather than UTF-8 encoding to handle foreign language characters in the
project properties.</li>

    <li>Added the option to create a new Sandcastle Help File Builder
project by importing the assembly information from a Visual Studio
2003/2005 solution or project file.</li>
    <li>Added the <code>HelpFileFormat</code> property to let you define the

    <li>Renamed the <code>HtmlHelpCompilerPath</code> property to
<code>HtmlHelp1xCompilerPath</code> for the HTML 1.x help compiler
(<b>HHC.EXE</b>) and added the <code>HtmlHelp2xCompilerPath</code> property
for the HTML 2.x help compiler (<b>HXCOMP.EXE</b>).</li>
    <li>Added the project files necessary to build HTML 2.x help files and
