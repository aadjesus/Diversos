<h2>Welcome to the Sandcastle Help File Builder</h2>
Sandcastle is the tool used for creating MSDN-style documentation from .NET
assemblies and their associated XML comments files.  The current version is
the March 2007 CTP.  It is command line based and has no GUI front-end,
project management features, or automated build process that you can find
in NDoc.  I created the <b>Sandcastle Help File Builder</b> to fill in the
gaps and provide some of the missing NDoc-like features that I use most
often, as well as provide graphical and command line based tools to build a
help file in an automated fashion.

<p/>The project is hosted at <b>CodePlex</b> in the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a>
project.  Go there for the latest release, source code, the issue tracker,
and discussion boards.

<p/>Using the help file builder provides the following advantages:

<ul>
    <li>The GUI interface is almost identical to the NDoc interface so anyone
familiar with NDoc should be quite comfortable using it.</li>
    <li>You can import several settings from an existing NDoc project to
start a new Sandcastle Help File Builder project.</li>
    <li>You can import the assembly and documentation file information from
a Visual Studio 2003/2005 solution or project file to start a new
Sandcastle Help File Builder project.</li>
    <li>The builder will automatically locate both Sandcastle and the HTML
help compilers by looking in the system path and in the Program Files
special folder on all fixed hard drives.  Properties are also supplied for
you to specify the paths in the off-chance that it cannot locate them
automatically.</li>
    <li>The builder can produce an HTML 1.x (.CHM) file, an HTML 2.x
(.HxS) file, and/or a website.  The website output contains an index page
and tree view that can be used to navigate the table of content.</li>
    <li>There is built-in support for documenting multiple assemblies and
producing a single-help file for them.  The assemblies to document can be
executable (.EXE) or library (.DLL) assemblies.</li>
    <li>The settings are saved in a project file and the help file can be
built from within the GUI or you can add a post-build step to a Visual
Studio project that runs the command line tool to build it for you using
the same project file.</li>
    <li>The intermediate files used to create the help file are placed in a
working folder beneath an output folder of your choosing.  They can be
automatically removed after a successful build or kept around for further
modifications.</li>
    <li>The build process provides full logging and error handling.  All
output from the build is stored in a text file in the output folder.</li>
    <li>Several of the NDoc features that I use most often have been built
into the Sandcastle help file builder including:
    <ul>
        <li>Definition of project summary and namespace summary comments
that will appear in the help file.  You can also easily indicate which
namespaces to include or exclude from the help file.</li>
        <li>The ability to turn off documentation of attributes.</li>
        <li>Automatic determination of the default topic for the help file.</li>
        <li>Inclusion of additional help file content (i.e. your own HTML
pages, images, etc).  Unlike NDoc, you can also take steps to have the extra
HTML pages included in the help file's table of content, indicate which
item should be the default page, the order of the entries, and create
hierarchical additional content in the table of content.</li>
        <li>You have control over the help file name, title, header text,
and footer information such as the e-mail address, copyright text, and
copyright URL.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>I have added features to let you control the language of the help
file.</li>
    <li>Steps have been taken to make the build process fairly open so that
you have a chance to customize it without having to modify the code for the
builder application itself.</li>
</ul>

In addition to the help file builder, the following custom build components
are supplied:

<ul>
    <li>A code block component that extends the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
XML comment tag with file inclusion, syntax highlighting, line numbering,
collapsible <code>#region</code> and <code>#if/#else/#endif</code>
sections, and a copy to clipboard option.</li>
    <li>A post-transform component that can be used to add a logo image to the
header of each page, make some minor adjustments to the syntax section, and
add version information to the help topics.</li>
    <li>A "show missing" component that adds "missing" notes for missing
summary, returns, param, value, and remarks documentation tags and that
can also auto-document constructors.</li>
</ul>

The custom build components can also be used outside of the help file
builder in other build scripts and automated tools as well.

</p>This help file was built using the help file builder and demonstrates many
of the features that it provides.
