<h2>The Post-Transform Component</h2>
The Post-Transform Component is used to provide the following additional
features to modify the transformed HTML for a help topic.

<ul>
    <li>This acts as a companion component to the Code Block Component to
add the supporing links for the colorizer script and stylesheet only when
required.</li>
    <li>It can insert a logo image at the top of each help topic.  Both the
Prototype and VS2005 styles are supported.</li>
    <li>For the Prototype style, it hides the language combo box if only
one language appears in the Syntax section and it also hooks up the code
blocks to the language filter.</li>
    <li>This acts as a companion component to the Version Information
Component to add version information to the help topics if used with the
help file builder.  If used outside the help file builder, a modification
is required to the Sandcastle reference content files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Post-Transform Component Configuration</h3>
The following is the default configuration for the post-transform
component. All attribute names and values are case-sensitive.  It should be
inserted into the configuration file right after the
<code>TransformComponent</code>.  This component can be used by itself if
you do not want to use the code block and/or version information
components.  However, this component is required and must be used if you do
use the code block and/or version information components.

<p/>If the version information component is used, this component will
insert the version information found into the help topic.  For the code
block component, it adds the script and stylesheet links to the document's
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.  While they could both be inserted into
the first code element by the code block component and would work, the link
for the stylesheet is only considered valid HTML if it appears in the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. By using this component to insert it, it
keeps the HTML well formed and valid.  Since it is inserting the stylesheet
link, I placed the code to insert the script element in here as well.  In
addition, for the Prototype style it adds JavaScript to connect the code
blocks up to the language filter provided that the
<code>CodeBlockComponent</code> has been used as well.  The Prototype style
uses a different method for its language filter which requires some
additional steps to register the code blocks so that they are shown and
hidden correctly.

<pre lang="xml" title="Example Configuration">
&lt;!-- Post-transform component configuration.  This must appear after the
     TransformComponent.  See also: CodeBlockComponent. --&gt;
&lt;component type="SandcastleBuilder.Components.PostTransformComponent"
  assembly="{@SHFBFolder}SandcastleBuilder.Components.dll"
  id="Post-transform Component"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Code colorizer files (required).
         Attributes:
            Stylesheet file (required)
            Script file (required)
            "Copy" image file (required) --&gt;
    &lt;colorizer stylesheet="{@SHFBFolder}Colorizer\highlight.css"
        scriptFile="{@SHFBFolder}Colorizer\highlight.js"
        copyImage="{@SHFBFolder}Colorizer\CopyCode.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Output path for the files (required).  This should match the
         output path of the HTML files (see SaveComponent below). --&gt;
    &lt;outputPath value="Output\html" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Logo image file (optional).  Filename is required. The height,
         width, altText, placement, and alignment attributes are
         optional. --&gt;
    &lt;logoFile filename="" height="0" width="0" altText=""
        placement="left" alignment="left" /&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</pre>

The example given above is taken from the Sandcastle Help File Builder's
configuration file.  When used with it, you may specify the replacement tag
<code>{@SHFBFolder}</code> to insert the help file builder's folder in the
file path.  This is replaced at build time with the appropriate value. This
replacement tag can also be specified in the configuration dialog when
configuring project-specific configurations for the component from within
the help file builder.  The same applies to the <code>{@ProjectFolder}</code>
replacement tag which can be used in the logo image's <code>filename</code>
attribute to insert a reference to the project folder.  If using the
component in your own build scripts, replace the tags with an actual
absolute or relative path.

<p/>The colorizer element defines the files used by the code colorizer
script.  The <code>stylesheet</code> attribute defines the stylesheet to
use for the colorized code.  The <code>scriptFile</code> attribute defines
the script file containing the JavaScript code used to show and hide the
collapsible sections and copy the code to the clipboard (Internet Explorer
only).  The <code>copyImage</code> attribute defines the image file to use
for the "Copy Code" link.  The supplied <b>highlight.css</b>,
<b>highlight.js</b>, and <b>CopyCode.gif</b> files are used by default. You
can edit the stylesheet to use different colors for the highlighted code
elements.  If using the help file builder, you can also add a new
stylesheet using the same name to the <code>AdditionalContent</code>
property and set its destination folder to <b>html\</b> to overwrite the
default stylesheet.  The same applies to the image file.  However, its
location is determined by the <code>copyImageUrl</code> attribute in the
code block component's configuration.

<p/>The <code>outputPath</code> element is used to specify where the
stylesheet and script files are to be copied.  This should match the same
output path that is used in the <code>SaveComponent</code> that saves the
help topic files.  By default, it is <b>Output\html</b>.  The image file is
copied to the location specified in the <code>CodeBlockComponent</code>
configuration which is relative to this path.  See its description for
details.

<p/>The <code>logoFile</code> element is optional.  Using it, you can add a
logo image to the header of each help topic page that will appear to the
left, right, or above the topic title.  If no image file is specified or
the element is omitted, no image will appear in the header.  The
<code>height</code> and <code>width</code> attributes can be used to
specify the height and width of the image.  If omitted or set to zero, the
image will be displayed using its actual size. By using these attributes,
you can scale a larger image down or scale a smaller image up to get a
better fit.  The configuration dialog for the component allows you to
select an image and adjust its size with a preview area.  The
<code>altText</code> attribute lets you specify some alternate text that
can appear for the image.  The <code>placement</code> attribute allows you
to specify where the image is placed (to the left, to the right, or above
the topic title).  When set to <code>above</code>, the <code>alignment</code>
attribute specifies how the image is aligned (left, right, or centered).

<p/>As noted, the component can insert version information into the topic
when used with the <code>VersionInformationComponent</code>. If not used,
no version information will be listed.  The help file builder contains the
necessary modifications to its reference content files to add version
information.  If you use this component in your own scripts or build tools,
you will need to modify the Sandcastle reference content files in order to
add the version parameter.  To do so, add the text "Version: {2}" to the
<code>locationInformation</code> entry in the <b>reference_content.xml</b>
file for the Prototype and VS2005 styles and the
<code>requirementsAssemblyLayout</code> entry in the
<b>reference_content.xml</b> file for the VS2005 style.
