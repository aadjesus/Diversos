<h2>The Version Information Component</h2>
The version information component is used to extract version information
from the reflection information file and pass it on to the
<code>PostTransformComponent</code> so that it can insert it into the help
topic.  The functionality in this component used to be integrated with the
<code>PostTranformComponent</code> itself.  However, looking up the version
information after transformation of the topic proved to be too slow.  Moving
the lookup so that it occurs before transformation allows for an optimized
lookup of the version information and the whole reflection file does not
need to be loaded thus reducing memory usage for large builds and speeding
up the searches for version information.

<h3>The Version Information Component Configuration</h3>
The following is the default configuration for the version information
component. It should be inserted into the configuration file before the
<code>TransformComponent</code>.  As noted earlier, this component must be
paired with the <code>PostTransformComponent</code> as it is used to insert
the version information into the topic after the transformation to HTML.

<pre lang="xml" title="Example Configuration">
&lt;!-- Version information component configuration.  This must appear
     before the TransformComponent.  See also: PostTransformComponent --&gt;
&lt;component type="SandcastleBuilder.Components.VersionInfoComponent"
  assembly="{@SHFBFolder}SandcastleBuilder.Components.dll"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Reflection information file for version info (required) --&gt;
    &lt;reflectionFile filename="reflection.xml" /&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</pre>

The example given above is taken from the Sandcastle Help File Builder's
configuration file.  When used with it, the replacement tag
<code>{@SHFBFolder}</code> is used to insert the help file builder's folder
in the file path.  This is replaced at build time with the appropriate
value.  If using the component in your own build scripts, replace the tag
with a relative or absolute path to the component assembly.  The
<code>reflectionFile</code> element is required and should contain the path
to the reflection information file.

<p/>The help file builder contains the necessary modifications to its
reference content files to add version information.  If you use this
component in your own scripts or build tools, you will need to modify the
Sandcastle reference content files in order to add the version parameter.
To do so, add the text "Version: {2}" to the
<code>locationInformation</code> entry in the <b>reference_content.xml</b>
file for the Prototype and VS2005 styles and the
<code>requirementsAssemblyLayout</code> entry in the
<b>reference_content.xml</b> file for the VS2005 style.
