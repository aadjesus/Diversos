Text data file is the rectangular table of fields separated by either space or tab.
Data file must contain one header line and one or more series points lines.

Header line is the list of string column names ( > 1) and looks like
name1 name2 name3 name4
First column is treated as abscissa.

Series points line is the list of series values and looks like
100 1/1/2008 term 35.0
Token counts in the header and in each series line must be equal.

Each column values must be convertible to the same base type.
Base type is determined by the first series line in the following manner:
1. If the token can be converted to double, the base type is double.
2. If the token can be converted to DateTime, the base type is DateTime.
3. Otherwise the base type is string.
