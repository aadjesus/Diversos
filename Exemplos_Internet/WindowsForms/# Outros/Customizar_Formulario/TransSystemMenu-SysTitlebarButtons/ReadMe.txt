From Author,

Their have been many requests to split this project, so I have.
But this may not be split to everyone's liking.  I was not able to split
the entire project using Visual Studio .NET 2003. So, what I have done is 
I have split the project so that the transparent menu code can work in
Visual Studio .NET 2003 by itself, I have also configured the System-Titlebar
button so that it can work in Visual Studio .NET 2005 by itself.

It was necessary to use the two different compilers due to an error that
was occurring when I tried converting the System-Titlebar Button to be stand-alone.

I do hope that this update will be helpfull to any TheCodeProject user who wished this 
project to be split.  For those users who didn't mind not having the project split,
I have not altered any of the code from the original project, I have only added a project
to the Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution.
