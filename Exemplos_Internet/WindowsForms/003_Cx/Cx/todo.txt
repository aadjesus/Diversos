If I add a DAL, does this mean that the DAL would duplicate the same "model" as is in use by Calculator?
Let's also add a validation component to show this is wired up.
Let's add a scientific calculator operators and show how these can be swapped at runtime

* Easier wireup of control data messages, so we don't have to code event handlers that convert .NET events to Cx data events.

* Multiple components per assembly

A UI for wiring up producers and consumers

Add a keyboard component for the calculator.

Consider reformatting the components metadata to:

<Components>
  <Assembly>
    <VisualComponent>
    <VisualComponent>
    ...
  </Assembly>
  
  <Assembly>
  ...
</Components>  
  
Need way of specifying the generic type and the fully qualified assembly name when working with generic components like the list converter.
