		<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
		<p>In a recent project I decided that using a multiple-document interface (MDI) 
			would be the best approach. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy creating an 
			MDI application in Visual Studio and on the .NET platform is. Simply setting 
			the <code>IsMdiContainer</code> property of the <code>System.Windows.Forms.Form</code>
			allows other forms to be hosted in the application workspace. If you're like 
			me, however, you begin to wonder what that workspace would look like with a 
			different color, custom painting, or maybe a different border style. I quickly 
			found that the <code>Form</code> control exposed no such properties to control 
			this behavior. A search of the web revealed that many others have desired to do 
			the same and had various approaches on how to accomplish this. After using 
			their suggestions successfully in my application and creating a few of my own, 
			I decided to collect all such information into one place and perhaps develop a 
			component that would allow easy setting of these properties.</p>
		<h2><a name="The MdiClient Control">The MdiClient Control</a></h2>
		<p>As it turns out the MDI area of a Windows<small><sup>®</sup></small> Form is 
			just another control. When the <code>IsMdiContainer</code> property is set to
			<span class="cs-keyword">true</span>, a control of type <code>System.Windows.Forms.MdiClient</code>
			is added to the <code>Controls</code> collection of the form. Iterating through 
			the form's controls after loading will reveal the <code>MdiClient</code> control 
			and is also probably the best way to get a reference to it. The <code>MdiClient</code>
			control <i>does</i> have a public constructor and <i>could</i> be added to the 
			form's <code>Controls</code> collection programmatically, but a better practice 
			is to set the form's <code>IsMdiContainer</code> property and have it do the 
			work. To set a reference to the <code>MdiClient</code> control, iterate through 
			the controls until the <code>MdiClient</code> control is found:</p>
		<pre lang="cs">MdiClient mdiClient = null;

// Get the MdiClient from the parent form.
for(int i = 0; i &lt; parentForm.Controls.Count; i++)
{
	// If the form is an MDI container, it will contain an MdiClient control
	// just as it would any other control.
	mdiClient = parentForm.Controls[i] as MdiClient;
	if(mdiClient != null)
	{
		// The MdiClient control was found.
		// ...
		//
		
		break;
	}
}</pre>
		<P>Using the
			<span class="cs-keyword">as</span>
			keyword here is better than a direct cast in a
			<span class="cs-keyword">try</span>/<span class="cs-keyword">catch</span>
			block or using the
			<span class="cs-keyword">is</span>
			keyword, because if the
			<span class="cs-keyword">type</span>
			is a match, a reference to the control will result or
			<span class="cs-keyword">null</span>
			will be returned. It's like getting two calls for the price of one.</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Note:</b> In tests I discovered that it is possible to add more than 
			one <code>MdiClient</code> control to the form's <code>Controls</code> collection. 
			In such a case, only one of the <code>MdiClient</code> controls will act as the 
			host and this code may fail by returning a reference to the <code>MdiClient</code>
			that is not performing the hosting of child forms. One more good reason to use 
			the <code>IsMdiContainer</code> property rather than adding the control to the 
			form manually.</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<h2><a name="What a Reference Can Do">What a Reference Can Do</a></h2>
		<h3><a name="Changing the Background Color">Changing the Background Color</a></h3>
		<p>With a reference to the <code>MdiClient</code> control in hand, many of the 
			common control properties can be set as you would expect. The most often 
			requested of course is changing the background color. The default background 
			color of the application workspace is global to all Windows<small><SUP>®</SUP></small>
			applications and can be changed in the Control Panel. The .NET framework 
			exposes this color in the <code>System.Drawing.SystemColors.AppWorkspace</code> 
			static property. Changing the background color is done as you would expect, 
			through the <code>BackColor</code> property:</p>
		<pre lang="cs">// Set the color of the application workspace.
mdiClient.BackColor = value;</pre>
		<P>That as well as many properties common to other controls will work as expected 
			with the <code>MdiClient</code> control.</P>
		<h2><a name="What a Handle Can Do">What a Handle Can Do</a></h2>
		<h3><a name="Changing the Border Styles">Changing the Border Styles</a></h3>
		<P>What's absent from the <code>MdiClient</code> control, however, is a <code>BorderStyle</code>
			property. Gone are the typical <code>System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle</code> enumeration 
			options of <code>Fixed3D</code>, <code>FixedSingle</code>, and <code>None</code>. 
			By default, the application workspace of a MDI form is inset with a 3D border 
			equivalent to what would be <code>Fixed3D</code>. Just because this behavior is 
			not exposed by the control does not mean it is not accessible. From this point 
			forward you will see that the <code>Handle</code> of the <code>MdiClient</code> 
			becomes much more valuable that just a reference to it.</P>
		<P>To change the appearance of the border requires the use of Win32 function calls. 
			(More information on this can be gleaned from Jason Dorie's article: <i><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/CsAddingBorders.asp">
					Adding designable borders to user controls</a></i>.) Each window (i.e. 
			- <code>Control</code>) in Windows<small><sup>®</sup></small> has information 
			that can be retrieved by using the <code>GetWindowLong</code> and set by using 
			the <code>SetWindowLong</code> function. Both functions require a flag that 
			specifies what information we would like to get and set. In this case we are 
			interested in the <code>GWL_STYLE</code> and the <code>GWL_EXSTYLE</code>, 
			which get and set the window style and the extended window style flags, 
			respectively. Because these changes are made to the non-client area of the 
			control calling the control's <code>Invalidate</code> method will not cause the 
			borders to be repainted. Instead, we call the <code>SetWindowPos</code> function 
			to cause an update of the non-client area. These functions and constants are 
			defined like this:</P>
		<pre lang="cs">// Win32 Constants

		<h3><a name="The NativeWindow Class">The NativeWindow Class</a></h3>
		<p>To move into the realm of customization beyond changing simple properties or 
			making Win32 calls, we need to intercept and process window messages. 
			Unfortunately the <code>MdiClient</code> class is
			<span class="cs-keyword">sealed</span>, and therefore, can't be subclassed nor 
			can its <code>WndProc</code> method be overridden. Thankfully the <code>System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow</code>
			class comes to the rescue. The intent of the <code>NativeWindow</code> class is 
			to provide "a low-level encapsulation of a window handle and a window 
			procedure". In other words, it allows us to tap into the window messages a 
			control receives. To make use of <code>NativeWindow</code>, inherit from the 
			class and override its <code>WndProc</code> method. Once a control's handle is 
			assigned to the <code>NativeWindow</code> via the <code>AssignHandle</code> method, 
			the <code>WndProc</code> method behaves just as if it was the control's <code>WndProc</code>
			method. With the ability to listen to the <code>MdiClient</code> control's 
			window messages a whole new range of customization is possible.</p>
		<h3><a name="Hiding the Scrollbars">Hiding the Scrollbars</a></h3>
		<p>While making controls outside the application workspace accessible by scrollbars 
			is a great feature, I personally can't remember an MDI application I've used 
			that does the same. Turning off or hiding the scrollbars in the <code>MdiClient</code>
			is a feature that may be more often requested than changing its color.</p>
		<P>The scrollbars of the <code>MdiClient</code> control are part of its non-client 
			area (area outside the <code>ClientRectangle</code>) and are not themselves 
			controls parented to the <code>MdiClient</code>. That rules out the possibility 
			of changing the visibility of the scrollbars and leaves us with window messages 
			and Win32 functions that affect the size of the non-client area. When the 
			non-client area of a control needs to be calculated, the control is sent a <code>WM_NCCALCSIZE</code>
			message. In order to hide the scrollbars, we could tell Windows<small><sup>®</sup></small>
			that the non-client area is a little bit smaller than it actually is and cover 
			up the scrollbars. My first approach to this was a failed attempt at trying to 
			determine what the size of the non-client area should be. A much better 
			approach would be to hide the scrollbars when the non-client area is calculated 
			using the <code>ShowScrollBar</code> Win32 function. The <code>ShowScrollBar</code>
			function requires the window handle, the scrollbars to be hidden, and a
			<span class="cs-keyword">bool</span>
			indicating its visibility:</P>
		<pre lang="cs">// Win32 Constants
private const int SB_HORZ = 0;
private const int SB_VERT = 1;
private const int SB_CTL  = 2;
private const int SB_BOTH = 3;

// Win32 Functions
[DllImport("user32.dll")]
private static extern int ShowScrollBar(IntPtr hWnd, int wBar, int bShow);


protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)
{
	switch(m.Msg)
	{
		//
		// ...
		//
		
		case WM_NCCALCSIZE:
			ShowScrollBar(m.HWnd, SB_BOTH, 0 /*false*/);
			break;
	}

	base.WndProc(ref m);
}</pre>
		<p>After hiding the scrollbar, the <code>WM_NCCALCSIZE</code> message is processed 
			as usual and calculates the non-client area less the recently hidden 
			scrollbars. In case you're wondering, hiding the scrollbar via the <code>ShowScrollBar</code>
			function does not keep the scrollbar hidden and is immediately reset to 
			visible. That is why it must be hidden every time the non-client area is 
			calculated.</p>
		<h3><a name="Advanced Painting">Advanced Painting</a></h3>
		<p>In .NET forums around the web another common request I see is, "How do I put an 
			image in the application workspace of an MDI form?" The easiest way is to 
			listen to the <code>Paint</code> event once you have a reference to the <code>MdiClient</code>. 
			For some situations this may work fine, but I noticed a very bad flicker every 
			time the <code>MdiClient</code> is resized. This is a result of the painting 
			not being double-buffered and painting calls being made in both the <code>WM_PAINT</code>
			and <code>WM_ERASEBKGND</code> messages. If we had been able to inherit from 
			the <code>MdiClient</code> control this could be easily remedied by using the 
			control's protected method <code>SetStyle</code> with the flags <code>System.Windows.Forms.ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint</code>,
			<code>ControlStyles.DoubleBuffer</code>, and <code>ControlStyles.UserPaint</code>. 
			But as noted earlier, the <code>MdiClient</code> class is
			<span class="cs-keyword">sealed</span>
			and that is not an option. What <i>is</i> an option is listening to the <code>WM_PAINT</code>
			and <code>WM_ERASEBKGND</code> window messages and implementing our own custom 
			painting. (More information on this is available in Steve McMahon's article: <i><a href="http://vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=4306">
					Painting in the MDI Client Area</a></i>.)
		</p>
		<P>The Win32 items we'll need are the functions <code>BeginPaint</code> and <code>EndPaint</code>, 
			structs called the <code>PAINTSTRUCT</code> and <code>RECT</code>, and a few 
			more constants:</P>
		<pre lang="cs">// Win32 Constants
private const int WM_PAINT       = 0x000F;
private const int WM_ERASEBKGND  = 0x0014;
private const int WM_PRINTCLIENT = 0x0318;


// Win32 Structures
[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Pack = 4)]
private struct PAINTSTRUCT
{
	public IntPtr hdc;
	public int fErase;
	public RECT rcPaint;
	public int fRestore;
	public int fIncUpdate;
	[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst=32)] public byte[] rgbReserved;
}

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
private struct RECT
{
	public int left;
	public int top;
	public int right;
	public int bottom;
}


// Win32 Functions
[DllImport("user32.dll")]
private static extern IntPtr BeginPaint(IntPtr hWnd, ref PAINTSTRUCT paintStruct);

[DllImport("user32.dll")]
private static extern bool EndPaint(IntPtr hWnd, ref PAINTSTRUCT paintStruct);</pre>
		<p>The typical method of double-buffering is to do all painting to an <code>Image</code>, 
			or rather, get the <code>Graphics</code> object <i>from</i> an <code>Image</code>
			instead of painting directly to the screen. When painting to the <code>Image</code>
			is complete then the <code>Image</code> itself is drawn to the screen. That way 
			all the control's painting is displayed at once instead of intermittent 
			painting that may be in progress. With the <code>MdiClient</code> control's 
			graphics being so simple we could easily do all the painting ourselves, but a 
			better practice is to not eliminate the base graphics from being draw, but to 
			incorporate them into our custom painting. That way if the <code>MdiClient</code>
			were somehow changed in a way we did not expect the painting should still be 
			correctly displayed. This is achieved by creating our own window message (<code>WM_PRINTCLIENT</code>) 
			and sending it to the base control using the <code>DefWndProc</code> (i.e. - 
			Default <code>WndProc</code>) method. What we get back in the graphics buffer 
			is a painting of the original control painted <i>by</i> the base control. (More 
			on this can be learned from J Young's article: <i><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/genmissingpaintevent.asp">
					Generating missing Paint event for TreeView and ListView controls</a></i>.) 
			From there any custom painting over top of it can be processed:</p>
		<pre lang="cs">protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)
{
	switch(m.Msg)
	{
		//Do all painting in WM_PAINT to reduce flicker.
		case WM_ERASEBKGND:
			return;

		case WM_PAINT:

			// Use Win32 to get a Graphics object.
			PAINTSTRUCT paintStruct = new PAINTSTRUCT();
			IntPtr screenHdc = BeginPaint(m.HWnd, ref paintStruct);

			using(Graphics screenGraphics = Graphics.FromHdc(screenHdc)) 
			{
				// Double-buffer by painting everything to an image and
				// then drawing the image.
				int width = (mdiClient.ClientRectangle.Width &gt; 0 ? mdiClient.ClientRectangle.Width : 0);
				int height = (mdiClient.ClientRectangle.Height &gt; 0 ? mdiClient.ClientRectangle.Height : 0);
				using(Image i = new Bitmap(width, height))
				{
					using(Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(i))
					{
						// Draw base graphics and raise the base Paint event.
						IntPtr hdc = g.GetHdc();
						Message printClientMessage =
							Message.Create(m.HWnd, WM_PRINTCLIENT, hdc, IntPtr.Zero);  
						DefWndProc(ref printClientMessage);
						g.ReleaseHdc(hdc);

						//
						// Custom painting here...
						//
					}

					// Now draw all the graphics at once.
					screenGraphics.DrawImage(i, mdiClient.ClientRectangle);
				}
			}

			EndPaint(m.HWnd, ref paintStruct);
			return;
	}

	base.WndProc(ref m);
}</pre>
		<blockquote><b>Note:</b> More information about the <code>BeginPaint</code>, <code>EndPaint</code>,
			<code>PAINTSTRUCT</code>, <code>RECT</code>, and <code>WM_PRINTCLIENT</code> can 
			be found in the Platform SDK or MSDN library.</blockquote>
		<p>Notice that in this case we do not let the <code>WM_PAINT</code> message fall 
			through to be processed by the base <code>WndProc</code> because that would 
			cause it to do its default painting right over what we had just done ourselves. 
			The <CODE>WM_ERASEBKGND</CODE> message is ignored because we want to do all the 
			painting at one time in the <code>WM_PAINT</code> message. Now the <code>MdiClient</code>
			control's <code>Paint</code> event will no longer flicker and custom painting 
			code can be placed in the processing of the <code>WM_PAINT</code> message 
			above.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="The MdiClientController Component">The MdiClientController Component</a></h2>
		<p>Rather than having to put this code into every project that is using a 
			multiple-document interface we could wrap this all up into a <code>System.ComponentModel.Component</code>
			that could be copied from project-to-project and dropped onto the design 
			surface. Included in the source files is a component I call the <code>MdiClientController</code>
			and is found in the <code>Slusser.Components</code> namespace. The component 
			inherits from <code>NativeWindow</code> and implements the <code>System.ComponentModel.IComponent</code>
			interface to give it its <code>Component</code> behavior. It incorporates all 
			the functionality discussed previously with the addition of some properties 
			that make it easy to place an <code>Image</code> in the application workspace.
		</p>
		<P>To use the component with a MDI form only the parent <code>Form</code> must be 
			passed in to the constructor or set through the <code>ParentForm</code> property. 
			To set the <code>MdiClientController</code> component's <code>ParentForm</code> 
			property in the designer, we have to customize the <code>Site</code> property 
			to determine if the component is dropped onto a <code>Form</code>. It helps 
			here to have a knowledge of Designers. If indeed the component is dropped onto 
			a form, we set the <code>ParentForm</code> property and it is properly 
			serialized in the designer code:</P>
		<pre lang="cs">public ISite Site
{
	get { return site; }
	set
	{
		site = value;

		if(site == null)
			return;

		// If the component is dropped onto a form during design-time,
		// set the ParentForm property.
		IDesignerHost host = (value.GetService(typeof(IDesignerHost)) as IDesignerHost);
		if(host != null)
		{
			Form parent = host.RootComponent as Form;
			if(parent != null)
				ParentForm = parent;
		}
	}
}</pre>
		<P>One of the challenges in creating this component is knowing when the component 
			will be initialized. <code>Components</code> dropped onto the designer are 
			initialized in the <code>InitializeComponent</code> method of the form's 
			constructor. If you inspect the <code>InitializeComponent</code> method created 
			by the designer you'll note that the form's properties are the last thing to be 
			set. If the <code>MdiClientController</code> were to scan for the <code>MdiClient</code>
			control in the form's <code>Controls</code> collection before the form's <code>IsMdiContainer</code>
			property is set, no <code>MdiClient</code> control would be found. The solution 
			is to know when the parent form's <code>Handle</code> is created. This will 
			surely indicate that all child controls and variables have been initialized and 
			when we can start to look for the <code>MdiClient</code>. If the parent form 
			does not have a <code>Handle</code> when the <code>ParentForm</code> property 
			is set the component will listen to the form's <code>HandleCreated</code> event 
			and get the <code>MdiClient</code> then:</P>
		<pre lang="cs">public Form ParentForm
{
	get { return parentForm; }
	set
	{
		// If the ParentForm has previously been set,
		// unwire events connected to the old parent.
		if(parentForm != null)
			parentForm.HandleCreated -= new EventHandler(ParentFormHandleCreated);

		parentForm = value;

		if(parentForm == null)
			return;

		// If the parent form has not been created yet,
		// wait to initialize the MDI client until it is.
		if(parentForm.IsHandleCreated)
		{
			InitializeMdiClient();
			RefreshProperties();
		}
		else
			parentForm.HandleCreated += new EventHandler(ParentFormHandleCreated);
	}
}

		<p>Once the <code>MdiClientController</code> has been added to the toolbox, simply 
			drag it onto the <code>Form</code> in the designer or double-click it and it 
			will be displayed in the component tray of the designer. The <code>MdiClientController</code>
			will not change the form's <code>IsMdiContainer</code> property, so you must 
			set it. All of the components properties follow the .NET naming conventions. 
			The border style functionality is wrapped up in the <code>BorderStyle</code> property. 
			The hiding of the scrollbars, I thought, was best put in an <code>AutoScroll</code>
			property. The <code>BackColor</code> and <code>Paint</code> events are now 
			accessible from the designer for your convenience. In addition there are three 
			properties that control the displaying of an <code>Image</code> in the client 
			area. The <code>Image</code> property sets the <code>Image</code> to display, 
			the <code>ImageAlign</code> property will place it in different locations of 
			the client area, and the <code>StretchImage</code> property will stretch it to 
			fill the entire client area. In addition, I've added a <code>HandleAssigned</code>
			event to indicate when the <code>MdiClient</code> has been found and its <code>Handle</code>
			assigned to the <code>NativeWindow</code>. Of course all this can be done 
			programmatically.</p>
		<h2><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
		<p>As with many projects that become articles, I had what I originally needed in 
			about 30 minutes, but spent several days preparing something that I could share 
			with my fellow programmers. The resulting component should suffice for the 
			majority of request regarding the appearance of MDI forms. It works nicely, it 
			plays nicely, and it makes applications look nice[ly]. There is still a great 
			deal more that could be added to the component if the need arises, which I'm 
			sure for some programmers, it will. There is one feature, or hurdle rather, 
			that I humbly admit I was not able to overcome: design-time preview. Using <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">
				Reflector</a> I discovered a great number of roadblocks that prevent the 
			design-time preview of the MDI area. I would welcome any suggestions on how to 
			overcome this. Enjoy.</p>
