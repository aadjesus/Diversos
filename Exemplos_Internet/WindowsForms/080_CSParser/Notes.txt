Problems with the CodeDom:
CodeCompile unit do not have space for using directives or ns mebers, so they are placed now into first default NS
using_alias_directive - no support found
nested namespaces - no support found ( so parser is flattening ns hierarchy)
variable declaration list (int i,j,k;) - no support - transformend to individual var declarations
pointer_type - no support found
"jagged" array type (array of arrays) - MS CSharpCodeProvider reverses order of ranks 
params keyword - not supported - param is there as orinary array type param
private modifier on nested delagate is not shown by CSharpCodeProvider (all other nested types works fine)
unsafe modifier - no support found
readonly modifier - no support found
volatile modifier - no support found
explicit interface implementation - not implemented yet (I think this can be done)
add and remove accessors for Event - no support found
virtual and override modifiers do not work in MS CSharpCodeProvider for events
Operator members and Destructors - no support found
Expressions - no unary expressions at all !!!, only one dim arrays, some operators not supported and more
Attribute targets : no support found
Attributes on accessor : no support found
If CompileUnit contains custom attributes in global scope, CSSharpCodeProvider prints then before global using directives 
(it is due to that using has to be in the first ns)
